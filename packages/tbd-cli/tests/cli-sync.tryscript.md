# tbd CLI: Sync Command

The sync command is core to tbd's multi-machine coordination. These tests verify
that changes are properly committed to the tbd-sync branch before push operations.

**Critical behavior being tested:**
1. Files written to the worktree are committed before push
2. No uncommitted changes remain after sync
3. Sync status accurately reports state
4. Error handling for missing remotes

---

## Core Sync Behavior: Commits Before Push

This is the most important test - verifying that `tbd sync` actually commits
files to the tbd-sync branch. Without this, changes would never be pushed.

# Test: Initial state has one commit (from init)

```console
$ git -C .tbd/data-sync-worktree log --oneline | wc -l | tr -d ' '
1
? 0
```

# Test: Creating an issue adds uncommitted files to worktree

```console
$ tbd create "Test sync commit behavior" --type task
✓ Created [..]
? 0
```

```console
$ git -C .tbd/data-sync-worktree status --porcelain | head -3
?? .tbd/data-sync/issues/[..]
?? .tbd/data-sync/mappings/ids.yml
? 0
```

# Test: Sync commits the uncommitted files

```console
$ tbd sync
✓ Synced[..]
? 0
```

# Test: After sync, no uncommitted changes remain

```console
$ git -C .tbd/data-sync-worktree status --porcelain
? 0
```

# Test: Commit count increased after sync

```console
$ git -C .tbd/data-sync-worktree log --oneline | wc -l | tr -d ' '
2
? 0
```

# Test: Commit message includes file count

```console
$ git -C .tbd/data-sync-worktree log -1 --format=%s
tbd sync: [..] (2 files)
? 0
```

---

## Multiple Issues and Updates

# Test: Create multiple issues, then sync once

```console
$ tbd create "Issue A" --type task
✓ Created [..]
? 0
```

```console
$ tbd create "Issue B" --type bug
✓ Created [..]
? 0
```

```console
$ tbd create "Issue C" --type feature
✓ Created [..]
? 0
```

# Test: Multiple uncommitted files before sync

```console
$ git -C .tbd/data-sync-worktree status --porcelain | grep -c "??" | tr -d ' '
3
? 0
```

# Test: Sync commits all pending changes

```console
$ tbd sync
✓ Synced[..]
? 0
```

# Test: All changes committed

```console
$ git -C .tbd/data-sync-worktree status --porcelain
? 0
```

---

## Sync Status Command

# Test: Sync status shows in-sync state

```console
$ tbd sync --status
✓ Repository is in sync
? 0
```

# Test: Sync status as JSON

```console
$ tbd sync --status --json
{
  "synced": true,
  "localChanges": [],
  "remoteChanges": [],
  "syncBranch": "tbd-sync",
  "remote": "origin",
  "ahead": 0,
  "behind": 0
}
? 0
```

# Test: Creating issue doesn't affect sync status (local only)

After creating an issue, sync status may show local changes.

```console
$ tbd create "Status test issue" --type task
✓ Created [..]
? 0
```

```console
$ tbd sync --status --json | node -e "d=JSON.parse(require('fs').readFileSync(0,'utf8')); console.log('synced:', d.synced)"
synced: [..]
? 0
```

---

## Error Handling

# Test: Sync push without remote fails gracefully

```console
$ tbd sync --push 2>&1
...
✗ Failed to push[..]
...
? 0
```

# Test: Sync pull without remote fails gracefully

```console
$ tbd sync --pull 2>&1
✗ Failed to pull[..]
...
? 0
```

# Test: Full sync handles missing remote gracefully

```console
$ tbd sync
✓ Synced[..]
? 0
```

---

## Idempotent Sync

# Test: Running sync twice in a row is safe

```console
$ tbd sync
✓ Synced[..]
? 0
```

```console
$ tbd sync
✓ [..]
? 0
```

# Test: No uncommitted changes after double sync

```console
$ git -C .tbd/data-sync-worktree status --porcelain
? 0
```
