# Test: .beads-hooks directory exists

```console
$ test -d .beads-hooks && echo ".beads-hooks exists"

## Setup Beads --disable Preview Mode

# Test: Setup beads --disable shows preview without changes

```console
$ tbd setup beads --disable
The following Beads files will be moved to .beads-disabled/:

  .beads/ → .beads-disabled/beads/ [..]
    Beads data directory
  .beads-hooks/ → .beads-disabled/beads-hooks/ [..]
    Beads git hooks
  .cursor/rules/beads.mdc → .beads-disabled/cursor-rules-beads.mdc
    Cursor IDE Beads rules
  .claude/settings.local.json → .beads-disabled/claude-settings.local.json [..]
    Claude Code project hooks with bd commands
  AGENTS.md → .beads-disabled/AGENTS.md.backup [..]
    AGENTS.md with Beads section
  .gitattributes → .beads-disabled/gitattributes.backup [..]
    .gitattributes with Beads merge driver

This preserves all Beads data for potential rollback.

To confirm, run: tbd setup beads --disable --confirm

After disabling Beads, run:
  tbd setup claude   # Install tbd hooks
  tbd setup cursor   # Install tbd Cursor rules (optional)
  tbd setup codex    # Update AGENTS.md for tbd (optional)
? 0
```

# Test: Files still exist after preview

```console
$ test -d .beads && echo ".beads still exists"
.beads still exists
? 0
```

```console
$ test -d .beads-hooks && echo ".beads-hooks still exists"
.beads-hooks still exists
? 0
```

```console
$ test -f .cursor/rules/beads.mdc && echo "beads.mdc still exists"
beads.mdc still exists
? 0
```

# Test: .beads-disabled not created in preview mode

```console
$ test -d .beads-disabled || echo "no .beads-disabled yet"
no .beads-disabled yet
? 0
```
