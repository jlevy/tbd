We track work as beads using tbd.
Run `tbd` for more on using tbd and current status.

## Instructions

1. Create epic bead: “Architecture revision: comprehensive YYYY-MM-DD” (today’s date)

2. Find all architecture docs in `docs/*/architecture/current/` (skip
   deprecated/archived)

3. For each doc, create a child bead: "Architecture revision: <doc-name>" with content
   referencing `tbd shortcut revise-architecture-doc` for that file

4. Work through each child bead, close when done

5. Close epic with summary
