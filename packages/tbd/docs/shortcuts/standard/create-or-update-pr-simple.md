We track work as beads using tbd.
Run `tbd` for more on using tbd and current status.

Instructions:

Create a to-do list with the following items then perform all of them:

1. Check if a PR already exists for this branch using `gh pr view`. If it does, you’ll
   be updating it. If not, you’ll create one.

2. Review all commits on this branch since it diverged from main:
   - Run `git log main..HEAD --oneline` to see commits
   - Run `git diff main...HEAD` to see all changes

3. Write a PR title and description:
   - Title should be concise and describe the change (e.g., “Add user authentication”)
   - Description should have a brief summary of what changed and why
   - If you’re changing an existing PR, update the title to be current
   - Use conventional commit prefixes: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`,
     `test`, `chore`, `plan`, `research`, `ops`, `process`. Scope is optional—only add
     when it resolves an important ambiguity.
     (See `tbd guidelines commit-conventions` for details.)

4. Create or update the PR:
   - If creating: `gh pr create --title "..." --body "..."`
   - If updating: `gh pr edit --title "..." --body "..."`

5. Report the PR URL to the user.
