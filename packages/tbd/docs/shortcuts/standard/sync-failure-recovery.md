When `tbd sync` fails to push (e.g., network errors, permission issues, branch
restrictions), use this workflow to preserve and recover issue data.

## When Sync Fails

```bash
# Save unsynced changes to the outbox
tbd save --outbox

# Commit the outbox to your working branch
git add .tbd/workspaces
git commit -m "tbd: save outbox"
git push
```

## Later, When Sync Works

In a new session or environment where sync works:

```bash
# Import from outbox (clears outbox on success)
tbd import --outbox

# Sync to push changes
tbd sync
```
