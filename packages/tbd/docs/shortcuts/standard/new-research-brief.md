We track issues with tbd.
Run `tbd` for more on using tbd and current status.

Instructions:

Create a to-do list with the following items then perform all of them:

1. Clarify the research topic with the user:
   - What question or problem are we investigating?
   - What is the scope and depth needed?
   - Are there specific technologies or approaches to evaluate?

2. Review existing research in docs/project/research/ if available.

3. Create the research document using the template:
   ```
   tbd template research-brief > docs/project/research/research-YYYY-MM-DD-topic.md
   ```
   (Fill in the date and an appropriate topic name.)

4. Begin research, updating the document as you learn.
   Ask the user for guidance when you need clarification or hit decision points.

5. Summarize findings and ask the user to review.
