Shortcut: Run Pre-Commit Rules, Review, and Commit

We track issues with tbd.
Run `tbd` for more on using tbd and current status.

Instructions:

Create a to-do list with the following items then perform all of them:

1. Follow the `tbd shortcut precommit-process` steps to review and run pre-commit
   checks.

2. If there are issues, ask for guidance.
   Otherwise, commit directly using the commit message format from
   `tbd guidelines commit-conventions`. Do NOT ask the user for permission to commit
   unless there are problems.

3. If commit is successful and if there is a PR already filed, update the PR
   description.
