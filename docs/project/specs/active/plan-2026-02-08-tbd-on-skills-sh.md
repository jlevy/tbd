# Feature: Publish tbd as a Skill on skills.sh

**Date:** 2026-02-08 (last updated 2026-02-08)

**Status:** Draft

## Overview

Evaluate and execute publishing tbd as a discoverable skill on
[skills.sh](https://skills.sh), Vercel's open ecosystem for agent skill distribution.
This would make tbd discoverable alongside other agent skills and installable via
`npx skills add`. tbd already functions as a "meta-skill" (single SKILL.md +
CLI resource library) — this effort is about distribution and discovery, not
architectural changes.

## Goals

- List tbd on skills.sh so users can discover it alongside other agent skills
- Enable `npx skills add` as an alternative installation path for the SKILL.md component
- Increase tbd's visibility in the agent tooling ecosystem
- Ensure tbd's SKILL.md is compliant with the Agent Skills open standard
- Understand what tbd already does vs what skills.sh provides, and avoid duplication

## Non-Goals

- Replacing tbd's npm-based CLI installation (`npm install -g get-tbd`)
- Converting tbd's guidelines/shortcuts into individual SKILL.md files (the meta-skill
  architecture is intentional — see research docs)
- Building a skills.sh competitor or alternative registry
- Making tbd dependent on skills.sh infrastructure

## Background

### The Agent Skills Ecosystem

Three components form the current ecosystem:

1. **Agent Skills Open Standard** ([agentskills.io](https://agentskills.io)) — Defines
   the SKILL.md format. Originally by Anthropic, adopted by 27+ agent products.

2. **skills.sh** ([skills.sh](https://skills.sh)) — Vercel's open ecosystem for
   discovering and installing skills. CLI: `npx skills add <owner/repo>`. 47K+ total
   installations. Supports Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, GitHub Copilot, Codex, Gemini
   CLI, and 17+ other agents.

3. **Anthropic Skills Repo** ([github.com/anthropics/skills](https://github.com/anthropics/skills)) —
   Reference implementations (65K+ stars).

### How skills.sh Works

```bash
npx skills add <owner/repo>
# 1. Clones the GitHub repo
# 2. Discovers SKILL.md files in skills/ directories
# 3. Interactive: user chooses which skills, which agents, global vs repo scope
# 4. Copies SKILL.md (+ supporting files) to .agents/skills/ and symlinks to agent dirs
```

Skills are installed to agent-specific directories:

```
.agents/skills/tbd/SKILL.md          # Canonical location
.claude/skills/tbd/SKILL.md          # Symlink for Claude Code
.cursor/skills/tbd/SKILL.md          # Symlink for Cursor
# etc.
```

### tbd's Current Skill Architecture

tbd already uses the meta-skill pattern (documented in
`research-skills-vs-meta-skill-architecture.md`):

```
.claude/skills/tbd/
  SKILL.md    # Generated by `tbd setup --auto`
```

This single SKILL.md describes tbd's full capabilities and instructs the agent to use CLI
commands (`tbd shortcut X`, `tbd guidelines X`) to access resources on demand. This is
the correct architecture for a resource-heavy CLI (50+ resources would exceed the 15K
character skill description budget if each were a separate skill).

### What tbd setup Already Does

`tbd setup --auto` already:

1. Creates `.claude/skills/tbd/SKILL.md` with the full workflow guide
2. Installs hook scripts (`.claude/scripts/tbd-session.sh`)
3. Updates `AGENTS.md` with tbd documentation
4. Syncs docs to `.tbd/docs/`

The question is: can skills.sh **also** install the SKILL.md, as a complementary
discovery/distribution channel?

### Progressive Disclosure Levels

| Level | Content | Who Provides | How Installed |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| L1 | Skill description (~100 tokens) | SKILL.md frontmatter | skills.sh or `tbd setup` |
| L2 | Skill body (~3K tokens) | SKILL.md markdown | skills.sh or `tbd setup` |
| L3 | Resources (unlimited) | `tbd guidelines X`, `tbd shortcut X` | `npm install -g get-tbd` + `tbd setup` |

skills.sh can handle L1-L2 distribution. L3 still requires the tbd CLI.

## Design

### What Gets Published to skills.sh

A GitHub repo (or a path within the tbd repo) containing a skills.sh-compatible skill
directory:

```
skills/
  tbd/
    SKILL.md          # The meta-skill (Agent Skills spec compliant)
```

### SKILL.md Compliance with Agent Skills Spec

Current tbd SKILL.md frontmatter:

```yaml
---
title: tbd Workflow
description: Full tbd workflow guide for agents
---
```

Agent Skills spec requires:

```yaml
---
name: tbd                    # Required: lowercase, 1-64 chars
description: ...             # Required: 1-1024 chars, "what + when"
---
```

**Changes needed:**

1. **Add `name` field** — `name: tbd` (spec requires this; `title` is not a standard
   field)
2. **Trim `description`** — Current description is fine but should include "when to use"
   per the spec's guidance: "Git-native issue tracking, coding guidelines, and workflow
   shortcuts for AI coding agents. Use when managing tasks, committing code, following
   engineering best practices, or planning features."
3. **Consider optional fields:**
   - `license: MIT` — tbd's license
   - `compatibility: Requires Node.js 18+ and git. Install CLI: npm install -g get-tbd`
   - `metadata.author: jlevy`
   - `metadata.version: "0.1.17"` — track which tbd version the skill was generated for

**SKILL.md body**: The existing generated content is comprehensive. For skills.sh
distribution, it could be slightly trimmed (the full shortcut/guideline directory tables
are large). Consider a more concise version for skills.sh that focuses on the core
workflow and points to `tbd shortcut --list` for the full directory.

### Repo Structure Options

**Option A: Separate skills repo** (e.g., `jlevy/tbd-skill`)

```
tbd-skill/
  skills/
    tbd/
      SKILL.md
  README.md
```

**Pros:** Clean, focused, easy to list on skills.sh
**Cons:** Another repo to maintain, SKILL.md can drift from tbd CLI

**Option B: Path within tbd repo** (e.g., `jlevy/tbd` with skills in a subdir)

```
jlevy/tbd/
  packages/tbd/skills/    # or skills/ at root
    tbd/
      SKILL.md
```

skills.sh supports installing from a subpath:
`npx skills add jlevy/tbd/packages/tbd/skills`

**Pros:** Single source of truth, SKILL.md stays in sync
**Cons:** Users install from a nested path (slightly less clean)

**Option C: Generate during npm publish** — Include the SKILL.md in the npm package and
also publish to a separate skills repo as part of the release pipeline.

**Pros:** Always in sync, clean install path for skills.sh
**Cons:** More build complexity

**Recommendation:** **Option B** for now (path within tbd repo), with potential migration
to Option C if the release pipeline grows. The SKILL.md is already generated by
`tbd setup` so keeping it in the repo is natural.

### Two Installation Paths (Complementary)

After publishing:

**Path 1: Full tbd setup (existing)**

```bash
npm install -g get-tbd
tbd setup --auto
# Installs CLI + SKILL.md + hooks + docs
# Everything works: beads, guidelines, shortcuts, sync
```

**Path 2: skills.sh discovery (new)**

```bash
npx skills add jlevy/tbd
# Installs SKILL.md only (L1-L2)
# Agent can read about tbd's capabilities
# But CLI commands won't work until npm install
```

**Bridging the gap:** The SKILL.md installed via skills.sh should detect whether the tbd
CLI is available and guide the agent to install it:

```markdown
## Prerequisites

Before using tbd commands, ensure the CLI is installed:

    npm install -g get-tbd@latest
    tbd setup --auto

If `tbd` is not available, install it first. All commands below require the CLI.
```

This way, skills.sh serves as a discovery/awareness channel, and the SKILL.md itself
guides users to full installation.

### Differences Between skills.sh SKILL.md and tbd setup SKILL.md

| Aspect | skills.sh version | tbd setup version |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Frontmatter | Agent Skills spec (`name`, `description`) | Current format (`title`, `description`) |
| Body | Concise (~2K tokens) with install instructions | Full directory tables (~5K+ tokens) |
| Shortcut table | Abbreviated (top 10 most useful) | Complete (30+ entries) |
| Guidelines table | Abbreviated (top 10) | Complete (25+ entries) |
| Install instructions | Prominent "install CLI first" section | Assumes CLI is installed |
| Updates | Manual (new commit to repo) | Auto-generated by `tbd setup --auto` |

**Recommendation:** Maintain two versions:

1. **skills.sh version** — Concise, focused on discovery and first-time setup.
   Manually maintained in the repo, updated at release time.
2. **tbd setup version** — Comprehensive, auto-generated with full directory.
   This is what `tbd setup --auto` produces.

The skills.sh version is a "landing page" that leads users to the full setup.

### What About Domain Knowledge Repos?

A compelling future possibility: domain knowledge repos like `rust-porting-playbook`
could also be listed on skills.sh with a thin SKILL.md wrapper:

```yaml
---
name: rust-porting-playbook
description: Comprehensive Rust porting guidelines and playbooks. Use when porting
  Python or other code to Rust. Requires tbd CLI for full access.
compatibility: Requires tbd CLI (npm install -g get-tbd)
---

# Rust Porting Playbook

This skill provides domain expertise for porting applications to Rust.

## Setup

    tbd source add github.com/jlevy/rust-porting-playbook

## Usage

    tbd guidelines rust-general-rules
    tbd guidelines python-to-rust-porting-rules
    tbd guidelines rust-cli-app-patterns
    ...
```

This creates a nice distribution chain:
1. User finds `rust-porting-playbook` on skills.sh
2. SKILL.md tells them to install tbd and add the source
3. `tbd source add` syncs the full knowledge repo
4. `tbd guidelines X` serves the docs on demand

**This is Phase 2 / future work** — depends on the external docs repos feature being
implemented first. Noted here for architectural awareness.

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: SKILL.md Compliance and Publishing

- [ ] Audit current SKILL.md against Agent Skills spec
  - Add `name: tbd` field
  - Adjust `description` to include "when to use" guidance
  - Add optional fields: `license`, `compatibility`, `metadata`
- [ ] Create a concise skills.sh version of SKILL.md
  - Trim to ~2K tokens (abbreviated shortcut/guideline tables)
  - Add prominent install instructions section
  - Add prerequisites section
- [ ] Create `skills/tbd/SKILL.md` directory in the tbd repo
- [ ] Test with `npx skills add` against the local/dev repo
- [ ] Submit to skills.sh (push to GitHub, verify listing)

### Phase 2: Integration and Polish

- [ ] Add skills.sh installation path to tbd README
- [ ] Update `tbd setup --auto` to also produce Agent Skills spec-compliant frontmatter
  (both `name` and `title` for compatibility)
- [ ] Consider CI step to validate SKILL.md compliance on each release
- [ ] Monitor skills.sh install metrics
- [ ] Explore listing domain knowledge repos as skills.sh entries (depends on external
  docs repos feature)

### Phase 3: Release Pipeline Integration (if needed)

- [ ] Auto-generate skills.sh SKILL.md from tbd setup output during npm publish
- [ ] Keep skills.sh version abbreviated but always in sync with current tbd version
- [ ] Version tag in metadata for tracking

## Testing Strategy

- Validate SKILL.md against the Agent Skills spec using `skills-ref validate`
- Test `npx skills add` from the repo (local clone)
- Test cross-agent installation (Claude Code, Cursor) to verify symlinks
- Verify that the skills.sh-installed SKILL.md guides users to CLI installation
- Verify that `tbd setup --auto` doesn't conflict with skills.sh-installed files
  (should overwrite gracefully)

## Risks and Considerations

1. **Two SKILL.md files to maintain** — The skills.sh version (concise) and the
   `tbd setup` version (comprehensive) could drift. Mitigate: update skills.sh version
   as part of the release checklist.

2. **Incomplete without CLI** — skills.sh installs only the SKILL.md, not the CLI.
   Agents will see tbd's capabilities but can't execute commands until `npm install`.
   The SKILL.md must make this very clear.

3. **Frontmatter compatibility** — The Agent Skills spec uses `name` while tbd uses
   `title`. Adding both fields is safe (the spec ignores unknown fields, and tbd's
   gray-matter parser handles extra fields). But long-term, consider converging.

4. **skills.sh ecosystem stability** — skills.sh launched Jan 2026 and is still early.
   The platform and CLI may evolve. Low risk since the investment is small (one SKILL.md
   file).

5. **Discovery vs confusion** — Users who find tbd via skills.sh might expect it to
   work immediately after `npx skills add`, but it requires `npm install` for the CLI.
   Clear messaging in the SKILL.md is essential.

## Open Questions

1. **Should `tbd setup --auto` detect and preserve a skills.sh-installed SKILL.md?**
   Currently it overwrites `.claude/skills/tbd/SKILL.md`. If skills.sh installed a
   version, `tbd setup` would replace it with the comprehensive version. This is
   probably fine (the comprehensive version is strictly better), but worth considering.

2. **Should the skills.sh SKILL.md include the hook script?** skills.sh supports
   `scripts/` directories in skills. We could include `tbd-session.sh` for agents that
   support hooks. But this adds complexity and may not work across all agents.

3. **Repo path vs separate repo?** Option B (path in tbd repo) is recommended but means
   users do `npx skills add jlevy/tbd/packages/tbd/skills` which is verbose. Verify
   this works well with skills.sh CLI.

4. **Should we also list individual domain knowledge repos?** The pattern of wrapping a
   doc repo with a thin SKILL.md is compelling but adds maintenance. Consider after
   external docs repos feature ships.
