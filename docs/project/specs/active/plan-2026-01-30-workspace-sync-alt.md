# Feature: Workspace Sync for Resilient Issue Syncing (Alternative Design)

**Date:** 2026-01-30

**Author:** Claude (with Joshua Levy)

**Status:** Draft (Alternative to outbox design)

## Overview

This spec addresses sync resilience: when `tbd sync` cannot push to the remote (network
errors, permission issues, Claude Code branch restrictions, etc.), issue data should be
preserved locally and recoverable when conditions allow.

This alternative design uses **explicit workspaces** instead of automatic write-through.
Users (or agents) explicitly save data to named workspaces when needed, rather than
having every write automatically mirrored.
This provides more flexibility and user control at the cost of requiring explicit
action.

## Goals

- **G1**: **No data loss** - Issue data can be preserved even when sync fails (via
  explicit save)
- **G2**: **User control** - User decides when and where to save, not automatic
- **G3**: **Flexible destinations** - Save to named workspaces OR arbitrary directories
- **G4**: **Bidirectional sync** - Workspaces can be merged back to worktree using
  standard merge logic
- **G5**: **Backup-friendly** - Easy to create full or incremental backups
- **G6**: Standard environments should continue working unchanged

## Non-Goals

- Automatic write-through (that’s the outbox model)
- Changing the fundamental sync architecture (worktree model remains)
- Special handling for specific environments (workspaces handle all scenarios)

## Use Cases

The workspace model supports several distinct workflows beyond sync failure recovery:

### Use Case 1: Sync Failure Recovery (Primary)

When `tbd sync` fails to push (e.g., in Claude Code with branch restrictions):

```bash
# Sync fails with HTTP 403
tbd sync
# ⚠️  Sync failed: HTTP 403 - push to 'tbd-sync' forbidden

# Save unsynced changes to outbox
tbd save --outbox

# Commit and push your working branch (which succeeds)
git add .tbd/workspaces/outbox && git commit -m "tbd: save outbox"
git push

# Later, in a new session where sync works:
tbd import --outbox    # Imports and clears outbox
tbd sync               # Pushes to remote
```

**Multiple agents/sessions**: Multiple clients can all save to the same outbox.
Since `tbd save` uses merge logic, concurrent saves work correctly:
- Different issues: No conflicts, all preserved
- Same issue edited compatibly: Merged automatically
- Same issue edited incompatibly: Conflict goes to attic (which is useful - you’d want
  to know if multiple agents are making incompatible edits to the same issue)

### Use Case 2: Bulk Editing Issues

Export issues to a temp directory, make systematic edits (via scripts or manually), then
import the changes back:

```bash
# Export all issues to a temp directory
tbd save --dir=/tmp/bulk-edit

# Make systematic edits (e.g., change all priorities, update labels, etc.)
# Could be manual edits or via sed/awk/scripts:
cd /tmp/bulk-edit/issues
sed -i 's/priority: P3/priority: P2/g' *.md

# Import the edited issues back
tbd import --dir=/tmp/bulk-edit

# Sync to remote
tbd sync
```

This is useful for:
- Bulk priority changes across many issues
- Adding/removing labels systematically
- Fixing typos in issue templates
- Migrating issue formats

### Use Case 3: Point-in-Time Backups

Create named snapshots of all issues at a particular point in time:

```bash
# Create a backup before major refactoring
tbd save --workspace=pre-refactor-2026-01

# ... work happens, issues change ...

# Later, if needed, see what changed
diff -r .tbd/workspaces/pre-refactor-2026-01/issues .tbd/data-sync-worktree/.tbd/data-sync/issues

# Or restore the backup
tbd import --workspace=pre-refactor-2026-01
```

### Use Case 4: Cross-Repository Issue Transfer

Transfer issues between repositories or share them externally:

```bash
# In source repo: export issues
tbd save --dir=/tmp/shared-issues

# Copy to another machine or share via any mechanism
scp -r /tmp/shared-issues user@other:/tmp/

# In destination repo: import issues
tbd import --dir=/tmp/shared-issues
tbd sync
```

### Use Case 5: Offline Work with Manual Sync

Work offline and manually manage syncing:

```bash
# Before going offline, save current state
tbd save --workspace=offline-snapshot

# Work offline, creating/updating issues normally
tbd create "New feature idea"
tbd update tbd-a1b2 --status in_progress

# When back online, issues are in the worktree
# No import needed since you worked in the worktree directly
tbd sync
```

### Use Case 6: Issue Review/Audit

Export issues for review or audit purposes:

```bash
# Export all issues to a readable format
tbd save --dir=/tmp/audit-2026-01

# Review issues, generate reports, etc.
ls /tmp/audit-2026-01/issues/*.md | wc -l  # Count issues
grep -l "status: open" /tmp/audit-2026-01/issues/*.md  # Find open issues
```

## Background

### Problem Discovery

During a tbd development session in Claude Code, `tbd sync` reported “Already in sync”
even though there were local commits not pushed to the remote.
Investigation revealed:

1. `tbd sync` successfully creates local commits
2. The push to `origin/tbd-sync` silently fails with HTTP 403
3. The error was swallowed (see tbd-ca3g for the silent error bug)
4. Even after fixing error reporting, the push still fails

### Root Cause: Push Restrictions

Various environments restrict which branches can be pushed:

- **Claude Code**: Enforces session-specific branch naming (`claude/*-{SESSION_ID}`)
- **Protected branches**: Some repos protect certain branch patterns
- **Network issues**: Transient connectivity problems
- **Permission issues**: User may lack push access to certain branches

### Current Impact (Before This Feature)

1. `tbd sync` fails with an error (HTTP 403, network error, etc.)
2. Issues are committed to the local `tbd-sync` worktree but never reach the remote
3. If the user does a fresh checkout, those issues are lost
4. No recovery mechanism exists

## Design

### Recommended Approach: Explicit Workspaces

Instead of automatic write-through to an outbox, users explicitly save their work to
**named workspaces** when needed.
This is more flexible and gives users full control.

### Architecture

```
.tbd/
├── data-sync-worktree/     # Existing: worktree on tbd-sync branch
├── workspaces/             # NEW: Named workspace directories (NOT gitignored)
│   ├── outbox/             # Special workspace for sync failure recovery
│   │   ├── issues/
│   │   ├── mappings/
│   │   │   └── ids.yml
│   │   └── attic/          # Conflicts during save to this workspace
│   ├── my-feature/         # User-created workspace
│   │   ├── issues/
│   │   ├── mappings/
│   │   │   └── ids.yml
│   │   └── attic/
│   └── backup-2026-01/     # Another user-created workspace
│       ├── issues/
│       ├── mappings/
│       │   └── ids.yml
│       └── attic/
├── config.yml
└── state.yml
```

**Key design choice**: Workspaces are on the user’s current branch (not gitignored), so
they survive across clones and checkouts when committed.

### Commands

#### `tbd save` - Save worktree to workspace

Saves data from the worktree to a workspace (or arbitrary directory).

```bash
# Save ALL issues to a named workspace
tbd save --workspace=my-feature

# Save ALL issues to an arbitrary directory
tbd save --dir=/tmp/my-backup

# Save only UPDATED (unsynced) issues to workspace
tbd save --workspace=my-feature --updates-only

# Convenience shortcut for sync failure recovery
tbd save --outbox
# Equivalent to: tbd save --workspace=outbox --updates-only
```

**Behavior:**
- By default, saves ALL issues from worktree to workspace
- With `--updates-only`, saves only issues that have been modified since last sync
- Uses bidirectional merge: if workspace has data, merge both directions
- Conflicts go to attic IN THE WORKSPACE (not data-sync-worktree)
- Does NOT auto-commit workspace changes

**One of `--workspace`, `--dir`, or `--outbox` is required.**

#### `tbd import` - Import from workspace to worktree

Imports data from a workspace (or arbitrary directory) into the worktree.

```bash
# Import from named workspace
tbd import --workspace=my-feature

# Import from arbitrary directory
tbd import --dir=/tmp/my-backup

# Import and clear workspace on success
tbd import --workspace=my-feature --clear-on-success

# Convenience shortcut for outbox recovery
tbd import --outbox
# Equivalent to: tbd import --workspace=outbox --clear-on-success
```

**Behavior:**
- Merges workspace data into worktree using standard merge logic
- Conflicts go to attic (in worktree, as usual)
- Commits merged changes to worktree
- With `--clear-on-success`: deletes the source workspace ONLY after successful import
- Without `--clear-on-success`: preserves the source workspace

**One of `--workspace`, `--dir`, or `--outbox` is required.**

#### `tbd workspace list` - List workspaces

```bash
tbd workspace list
```

Shows all workspaces in `.tbd/workspaces/` with item counts.

#### `tbd workspace delete` - Delete a workspace

```bash
tbd workspace delete my-feature
```

Removes the workspace directory.

### The `--outbox` Shortcut

The `--outbox` flag is a convenience for the common “sync failed, save my work”
scenario:

**For saving:**
```bash
tbd save --outbox
# Equivalent to: tbd save --workspace=outbox --updates-only
```

**For importing:**
```bash
tbd import --outbox
# Equivalent to: tbd import --workspace=outbox --clear-on-success
```

The `outbox` workspace is just a regular workspace with a special name.
There’s nothing magical about it - it’s simply the conventional place to save unsynced
changes. The `--clear-on-success` behavior for import makes sense for the outbox because
once you’ve successfully imported and can sync, you don’t need the backup anymore.

### Workspace Structure

Workspaces mirror the `data-sync` directory structure exactly:

```
.tbd/workspaces/my-feature/       # Mirrors .tbd/data-sync-worktree/.tbd/data-sync/
├── issues/
│   ├── {ulid1}.md                # Same filename format as worktree
│   └── {ulid2}.md
├── mappings/
│   └── ids.yml                   # Same YAML format
└── attic/                        # Conflicts during workspace operations
    └── {timestamp}_{ulid}.md
```

This identical structure means:
- No format conversion needed
- Existing issue parsing code works on workspace files
- Standard file comparison works

### Sync Flow with Workspaces

The workspace feature does NOT change the normal `tbd sync` flow.
It’s a separate set of commands for explicit save/restore operations.

```
Normal tbd sync (unchanged):

  1. Fetch remote tbd-sync
  2. Merge remote → worktree
  3. Commit local changes
  4. Push to remote
     ├── SUCCESS: Done
     └── FAILURE: Print error with instructions to use `tbd save --outbox`
```

When push fails, the user/agent explicitly runs `tbd save --outbox` to preserve their
work. This is a conscious decision, not automatic.

### `tbd save` Flow

```
tbd save --workspace=my-feature [--updates-only]:

  1. Ensure workspace directory exists
     └── Create .tbd/workspaces/my-feature/ if needed

  2. Determine what to save
     ├── --updates-only: Find issues modified since last successful sync
     └── default (--all): All issues in worktree

  3. For each issue to save:
     a. Check if issue exists in workspace
     b. If exists: Merge using standard algorithm
        - Base: none (or previous common version if tracked)
        - Ours: workspace version
        - Theirs: worktree version
        - Conflicts → workspace attic
     c. If not exists: Copy issue to workspace

  4. Merge ID mappings (union operation)

  5. Report what was saved
```

### `tbd import` Flow

```
tbd import --workspace=my-feature:

  1. Check workspace exists
     └── Error if not found

  2. For each issue in workspace:
     a. Check if issue exists in worktree
     b. If exists: Merge using standard algorithm
        - Conflicts → worktree attic (as usual)
     c. If not exists: Copy issue to worktree

  3. Merge ID mappings (union operation)

  4. Commit merged changes to worktree

  5. Report what was imported
```

### Push Failure Warning

When push fails, `tbd sync` prints a brief warning:

```
⚠️  Sync failed: {ERROR_DETAILS}

Options:
  1. Fix the issue and retry: tbd sync
  2. Save changes locally:    tbd save --outbox

Run `tbd save --help` for recovery workflow details.
```

### Agent Behavior on Sync Failure

When an AI agent encounters a sync push failure:

1. Run `tbd save --outbox` to save unsynced changes
2. Commit the outbox to the working branch
3. Push the working branch (which typically succeeds)
4. Data survives across checkouts and branch merges
5. Later, `tbd import --outbox` recovers the data and clears the outbox
6. Run `tbd sync` to push to remote

### Configuration

The workspace feature is always available (no config flag needed to enable it).
However, the suggested recovery command can be configured:

```yaml
# .tbd/config.yml
sync:
  branch: tbd-sync
  remote: origin
  # What to suggest when push fails (default: "tbd save --outbox")
  failure_suggestion: "tbd save --outbox"
```

## Comparison: Workspace vs Outbox Model

| Aspect | Outbox (Original) | Workspace (This Design) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **When data is saved** | Automatic (write-through on every operation) | Explicit (`tbd save` command) |
| **User action required** | None for saving; commit warning on failure | Must run `tbd save` on failure |
| **Flexibility** | Single outbox location | Multiple named workspaces + arbitrary dirs |
| **Backup use cases** | Not designed for backups | Natural backup support (`--all`) |
| **Complexity** | More complex (write-through logic, snapshot-based clear) | Simpler (explicit operations) |
| **Data safety** | Automatic but may be uncommitted | Explicit - user chooses when to save |
| **Sync overhead** | Every write duplicated | No overhead until save is called |
| **Agent workflow** | Agents commit outbox after failure | Agents run save + commit after failure |
| **Recovery** | Automatic on next sync | Explicit `tbd import` |

### Advantages of Workspace Model

1. **Simpler implementation** - No write-through logic, no snapshot-based clearing
2. **More flexible** - Multiple workspaces, arbitrary directories, full vs incremental
3. **Clear user control** - User decides what to save and when
4. **Better for backups** - Easy to create named backups of entire issue set
5. **No sync overhead** - Normal operations don’t duplicate writes
6. **Composable** - `save` and `import` are independent, reusable operations

### Advantages of Outbox Model

1. **Automatic safety** - Data preserved without user action
2. **No forgotten saves** - Can’t forget to save (it’s automatic)
3. **Transparent** - Users don’t need to know about outbox
4. **Simpler agent workflow** - Just commit on failure, no extra save step

### Recommendation

The workspace model is recommended if:
- Users/agents can be trained to run `tbd save --outbox` on failures
- Flexibility (multiple workspaces, backups) is valuable
- Simpler implementation is preferred

The outbox model is recommended if:
- Automatic safety is critical (users might forget to save)
- Agents should require minimal special handling
- The extra implementation complexity is acceptable

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Workspace Commands

**Directory Structure:**
- [ ] Add `.tbd/workspaces/` to standard tbd structure
- [ ] Workspace not gitignored (committed to user’s branch)

**`tbd save` Command:**
- [ ] Parse `--workspace=<name>`, `--dir=<path>`, `--outbox` flags
- [ ] Implement `--updates-only` vs default (all) behavior
- [ ] Implement bidirectional merge to workspace
- [ ] Conflicts go to workspace attic
- [ ] Report what was saved

**`tbd import` Command:**
- [ ] Parse `--workspace=<name>`, `--dir=<path>`, `--outbox` flags
- [ ] Implement `--clear-on-success` flag (deletes source after successful import)
- [ ] `--outbox` is shortcut for `--workspace=outbox --clear-on-success`
- [ ] Implement merge from workspace to worktree
- [ ] Commit merged changes to worktree
- [ ] Report what was imported

**`tbd workspace` Subcommands:**
- [ ] `tbd workspace list` - list workspaces with counts
- [ ] `tbd workspace delete <name>` - remove workspace

### Phase 2: Integration

**Sync Integration:**
- [ ] Update `tbd sync` failure message to suggest `tbd save --outbox`
- [ ] Add `--status` output for workspace counts

**Agent Guidelines:**
- [ ] Document agent workflow for sync failures
- [ ] Update tbd workflow documentation

### Phase 3: Documentation

- [ ] Update tbd-design.md with workspace support
- [ ] Add architecture diagram
- [ ] Add troubleshooting guide

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests

**Save Operations:**
- `saveToWorkspace()` - creates workspace, copies issues
- `saveToWorkspace()` with `--updates-only` - only unsynced issues
- `saveToWorkspace()` with existing workspace - merges correctly
- Conflicts go to workspace attic

**Import Operations:**
- `importFromWorkspace()` - merges to worktree
- `importFromWorkspace()` with conflicts - uses attic
- `importFromWorkspace()` commits to worktree

**Workspace Management:**
- `listWorkspaces()` - returns workspace names and counts
- `deleteWorkspace()` - removes directory

### Manual Testing Checklist

**Save Operations:**
- [ ] `tbd save --workspace=test` creates workspace with all issues
- [ ] `tbd save --workspace=test --updates-only` saves only modified issues
- [ ] `tbd save --outbox` is equivalent to `--workspace=outbox --updates-only`
- [ ] `tbd save --dir=/tmp/backup` saves to arbitrary directory
- [ ] Save to existing workspace merges correctly
- [ ] Conflicts go to workspace attic (not worktree attic)
- [ ] ID mappings are merged (union)

**Import Operations:**
- [ ] `tbd import --workspace=test` imports to worktree
- [ ] `tbd import --dir=/tmp/backup` imports from arbitrary directory
- [ ] `tbd import --workspace=test --clear-on-success` deletes workspace after import
- [ ] `tbd import --outbox` is equivalent to `--workspace=outbox --clear-on-success`
- [ ] Import merges with existing worktree data
- [ ] Conflicts go to worktree attic
- [ ] Changes are committed to worktree

**Bulk Edit Workflow:**
- [ ] Export with `tbd save --dir=/tmp/edit`
- [ ] Edit files externally (manual or script)
- [ ] Re-import with `tbd import --dir=/tmp/edit`
- [ ] Changes are merged correctly

**Workflow:**
- [ ] Push fails → warning suggests `tbd save --outbox`
- [ ] Full recovery: create → sync fails → save --outbox → fresh checkout → import →
  sync succeeds
- [ ] Agent can follow suggested workflow automatically

**Multi-Agent Scenarios:**
- [ ] Multiple agents can save to same outbox (different issues merge cleanly)
- [ ] Conflicting edits to same issue → conflict goes to outbox attic
- [ ] Attic preserves both versions for review

**Workspace Management:**
- [ ] `tbd workspace list` shows all workspaces
- [ ] `tbd workspace delete <name>` removes workspace

## Open Questions

1. **Should `--outbox` be the default behavior for save?**
   - Current design: `--outbox` is a shortcut, but one of
     `--workspace`/`--dir`/`--outbox` is required
   - Alternative: Make `tbd save` with no args equivalent to `tbd save --outbox`
   - Recommendation: Require explicit flag for clarity

2. ~~**Should import delete the source workspace after success?**~~
   - **Resolved**: Added `--clear-on-success` flag.
     Import is non-destructive by default, but `--clear-on-success` deletes workspace
     after successful import.
   - `--outbox` shortcut includes `--clear-on-success` since that’s the expected
     workflow.

3. **How to track “updated since last sync” for `--updates-only`?**
   - Option A: Compare timestamps with last successful sync
   - Option B: Track synced issue hashes in state.yml
   - Option C: Compare with remote tbd-sync branch
   - Recommendation: Option C - compare with what’s on remote

4. **Should workspaces support issue deletion tracking?**
   - Current design: Only tracks created/updated issues
   - If user deletes an issue, should that be saved to workspace?
   - Recommendation: No - tbd doesn’t delete issues, so not needed

## Appendix B: Implementation Notes

### Determining “Updated Since Last Sync”

For `--updates-only`, we need to know which issues have been modified since the last
successful sync. Options:

1. **Compare with remote**: Fetch the remote `tbd-sync` branch and compare issue file
   contents/timestamps
   - Pro: Accurate, no extra state needed
   - Con: Requires network access

2. **Track in state.yml**: Record last sync timestamp or issue hashes
   - Pro: Works offline
   - Con: More state to maintain

3. **Git diff in worktree**: Use `git diff` to find uncommitted/unpushed changes
   - Pro: Leverages git
   - Con: Only shows uncommitted changes, not “since last push”

Recommendation: Use option 1 (compare with remote) with fallback to option 3 (git diff)
when offline.

### Workspace Attic vs Worktree Attic

When saving to a workspace, conflicts go to the **workspace’s attic**, not the
worktree’s attic. This is because:

1. The worktree might not be accessible (that’s often why we’re using workspaces)
2. The conflict is between workspace and worktree versions
3. The user examining the workspace should see what conflicted

When importing from a workspace, conflicts go to the **worktree’s attic** (as usual).
This follows normal sync conflict resolution.

## Appendix C: Engineering Review - Workspace vs Outbox Model

### Detailed Comparison

| Aspect | Outbox Model | Workspace Model | Assessment |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Data safety trigger** | Automatic on every write | Explicit `tbd save` command | Trade-off: Auto is safer but adds overhead |
| **User awareness** | Transparent (user may not know outbox exists) | Explicit (user controls when to save) | Workspace gives more control |
| **Write performance** | 2x writes (worktree + outbox) | 1x writes (normal operation) | Workspace is faster |
| **Backup use cases** | Not supported | Full support (`--all`, named workspaces) | Workspace wins |
| **Cross-repo transfer** | Not supported | Supported via `--dir` | Workspace wins |
| **Bulk editing** | Not supported | Supported (export, edit, re-import) | Workspace wins |
| **Multi-agent scenarios** | Automatic (but each agent appends to outbox) | Explicit (agents call save, merge handles conflicts) | Comparable |
| **Recovery workflow** | Auto-recover on next sync | Explicit import | Outbox is simpler |
| **Agent training needed** | Minimal (just commit on failure) | Must learn `tbd save --outbox` | Outbox is simpler |
| **Implementation complexity** | Higher (write-through, snapshot clearing) | Lower (explicit commands) | Workspace wins |

### What We Kept from the Outbox Model

1. **Outbox concept**: The “outbox” remains as a special named workspace with convenient
   shortcuts
2. **Push failure detection**: Same error detection and warning messages
3. **Git-based persistence**: Data survives via commits to user’s working branch
4. **Merge-based conflict resolution**: Same three-way merge logic, conflicts to attic
5. **Multi-agent support**: Both models handle concurrent writers via merge

### What We Intentionally Changed

1. **Trigger mechanism**: Automatic write-through → Explicit save command
   - Rationale: Simpler, no performance overhead, more flexible

2. **Single location → Multiple destinations**: Fixed outbox → Named workspaces +
   arbitrary directories
   - Rationale: Enables backup, transfer, and bulk edit use cases

3. **Automatic recovery → Explicit import**: Outbox cleared on sync → User runs import
   - Rationale: More predictable, user controls when to integrate

4. **Snapshot-based clearing → `--clear-on-success`**: Complex snapshot logic → Simple
   flag
   - Rationale: Clearer semantics, less error-prone

### Gap Analysis

| # | Gap | Outbox Model | Workspace Model | Resolution |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | **Sync failure warning** | Suggests committing outbox | Suggests `tbd save --outbox` | Already covered - workspace model has clear warning message |
| 2 | **Corrupted/partial files** | Write-through might leave partial files | No issue (explicit save is atomic per-file) | N/A - workspace model handles this better |
| 3 | **Safe workspace deletion** | Snapshot-based clearing | `--clear-on-success` flag | Already covered - explicit is clearer |
| 4 | **Atomicity of save** | Write-through is per-operation | `tbd save` is a batch operation | Both work; workspace is more atomic overall |
| 5 | **Idempotency** | Re-running sync with outbox just re-merges | Re-running save/import is safe (merge is idempotent) | Both handle re-runs correctly |

**No gaps identified that require additional features.** The workspace model covers all
safety scenarios from the outbox model while adding flexibility.

### Features Gained

1. **Named workspaces**: Multiple independent save locations
2. **Arbitrary directories**: `--dir` flag for non-tbd locations
3. **Full vs incremental**: `--all` (default) vs `--updates-only`
4. **Bulk editing workflow**: Export, edit externally, re-import
5. **Point-in-time backups**: Named snapshots for rollback
6. **Cross-repo transfer**: Copy issues between repositories

### Risk Assessment

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| User forgets to save on failure | Medium | Data loss | Clear warning message, agent training |
| Agent doesn't follow recovery workflow | Low | Data loss | Document in agent guidelines, test in CI |
| Workspace not committed | Medium | Data lost on checkout | Warning in save output: "Remember to commit" |
| Confusion about workspace vs worktree | Low | User confusion | Clear documentation, help text |

### Conclusion

**Recommendation: Proceed with Workspace Model**

The workspace model is the better choice because:

1. **Simpler implementation**: No write-through logic, no snapshot-based clearing
2. **More flexible**: Supports backups, bulk edits, cross-repo transfer
3. **Explicit control**: Users know what’s happening and when
4. **No performance overhead**: Normal operations aren’t slowed by outbox writes
5. **Covers all safety scenarios**: The `--outbox` shortcut provides equivalent
   protection to the automatic outbox

The only downside is requiring explicit user action on sync failure, but:
- The warning message makes this clear
- Agents can be trained to follow the workflow
- The trade-off for flexibility and simplicity is worth it

**Implementation Priority:**
1. Core `tbd save` and `tbd import` commands
2. `--outbox` shortcuts for common recovery workflow
3. `tbd workspace list/delete` for management
4. Integration with sync failure messages
