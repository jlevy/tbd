# Plan Spec: Automatic GitHub CLI Setup via SessionStart Hook

## Purpose

This spec designs the feature for tbd to automatically ensure the GitHub CLI (`gh`)
is installed and authenticated in agent sessions by managing an `ensure-gh-cli.sh`
script in `.claude/scripts/`. This behavior is on by default but can be disabled via
CLI flag or config setting.

## Background

The GitHub CLI is essential for agent workflows: creating PRs, managing issues,
interacting with GitHub's API. Currently, this project manually includes an
`ensure-gh-cli.sh` script in `.claude/scripts/` and a corresponding SessionStart hook
in `.claude/settings.json`. This works but requires manual setup per project.

tbd already manages Claude Code hooks and scripts during `tbd setup` (see setup.ts).
It installs a global `tbd-session.sh` script to `~/.claude/scripts/` and configures
SessionStart/PreCompact hooks in `~/.claude/settings.json`. It also installs
project-local hooks in `.claude/settings.json` for PostToolUse reminders.

This feature extends that pattern to also manage a project-local `ensure-gh-cli.sh`
script and its corresponding SessionStart hook entry in `.claude/settings.json`.

  \- Designed the unified `tbd setup` command
- [github-cli-setup.md](../../../general/agent-setup/github-cli-setup.md)
  \- Existing documentation for GitHub CLI setup and GH_TOKEN

## Summary of Task

Add automatic GitHub CLI installation to tbd's setup flow:

1. **New config setting**: `settings.use_gh_cli` (boolean, default: `true`) in
   `.tbd/config.yml`
2. **New CLI flag**: `--no-gh-cli` on `tbd setup` to disable the feature
3. **Idempotent script management**:
   - When `use_gh_cli` is `true` (default): `tbd setup` installs
     `.claude/scripts/ensure-gh-cli.sh` and adds a SessionStart hook entry in
     `.claude/settings.json` if they don't already exist
   - When `use_gh_cli` is `false`: `tbd setup` removes
     `.claude/scripts/ensure-gh-cli.sh` and the corresponding SessionStart hook entry
     if they exist
4. **`--no-gh-cli` flag behavior**: Sets `use_gh_cli: false` in config and triggers
   the removal path
5. **Documentation**: Update reference docs to explain that tbd installs gh by default
   and how to disable it

## Backward Compatibility

| Area | Impact | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Code | Backward compatible | New optional config field with default preserving new behavior |
| API | N/A | No API changes |
| File format | Backward compatible | New optional `settings.use_gh_cli` field; missing = `true` |
| Database schema | N/A | No database |

## Stage 1: Planning Stage

### Feature Requirements

1. **Config Setting**
   - `settings.use_gh_cli: true` (default) in `.tbd/config.yml`
   - When missing from config, treated as `true`
   - Preserved across `tbd setup` runs (not overwritten if explicitly set to `false`)

2. **CLI Flag**
   - `tbd setup --no-gh-cli` sets `use_gh_cli: false` in config
   - `tbd setup` (without flag) preserves whatever `use_gh_cli` is in config
   - `tbd setup --no-gh-cli` is equivalent to manually setting `use_gh_cli: false`
     and running setup

3. **Script Installation (when `use_gh_cli` is `true`)**
   - Copy `ensure-gh-cli.sh` to `.claude/scripts/ensure-gh-cli.sh` in the project
   - Make it executable (chmod 755)
   - Add a SessionStart hook entry in `.claude/settings.json` that runs the script
   - Idempotent: skip if script already exists with correct content, update if stale

4. **Script Removal (when `use_gh_cli` is `false`)**
   - Remove `.claude/scripts/ensure-gh-cli.sh` if it exists
   - Remove the corresponding SessionStart hook entry from `.claude/settings.json`
   - Idempotent: no-op if already removed

5. **Script Source**
   - The `ensure-gh-cli.sh` script content should be bundled in the tbd package
     (as a string constant in setup.ts, following the pattern of `TBD_SESSION_SCRIPT`
     and `TBD_CLOSE_PROTOCOL_SCRIPT`)

6. **Hook Entry Format**
   - Added to the project-local `.claude/settings.json` (not global), since this is
     per-project behavior
   - SessionStart entry with matcher `""`, command pointing to the project script:
     `bash .claude/scripts/ensure-gh-cli.sh`, timeout 120

### Acceptance Criteria

1. Fresh `tbd setup --auto` installs `ensure-gh-cli.sh` and SessionStart hook
2. Subsequent `tbd setup --auto` is idempotent (no duplicate hooks)
3. `tbd setup --no-gh-cli` removes the script and hook, sets config to `false`
4. Manually setting `use_gh_cli: false` in config and running `tbd setup --auto`
   removes the script and hook
5. `use_gh_cli` defaults to `true` when missing from config
6. Config value is preserved across setup runs (not reset to `true` unless
   `--no-gh-cli` is absent AND config has no value)
7. Reference docs updated

### Not in Scope

- Global installation of gh CLI (this is project-local)
- Managing GH_TOKEN (that's an environment variable, documented separately)
- Supporting non-Claude agents (this uses Claude Code's hook system)

## Stage 2: Architecture Stage

### Files to Modify

```
packages/tbd/src/
├── cli/commands/
│   └── setup.ts           # Add script constant, install/remove logic, --no-gh-cli flag
└── lib/
    └── schemas.ts          # Add use_gh_cli to SettingsSchema
```

```
docs/
└── general/agent-setup/
    └── github-cli-setup.md   # Update to reference tbd auto-setup
```

### Schema Change

```typescript
// In schemas.ts - SettingsSchema
export const SettingsSchema = z.object({
  auto_sync: z.boolean().default(false),
  doc_auto_sync_hours: z.number().default(24),
  use_gh_cli: z.boolean().default(true),   // NEW
}).default({});
```

### Setup.ts Changes

1. **New constant**: `ENSURE_GH_CLI_SCRIPT` - the script content (same as current
   `.claude/scripts/ensure-gh-cli.sh` in this repo)

2. **New constant**: `GH_CLI_HOOK_ENTRY` - the SessionStart hook object:
   ```typescript
   {
     matcher: '',
     hooks: [{ type: 'command', command: 'bash .claude/scripts/ensure-gh-cli.sh', timeout: 120 }],
   }
   ```

3. **Modified `installClaudeSetup()`**: After installing project-local hooks, check
   `use_gh_cli` config setting:
   - If `true`: install `ensure-gh-cli.sh` to `.claude/scripts/`, add SessionStart
     hook entry to project `.claude/settings.json` (idempotent - check if already
     present by matching command string)
   - If `false`: remove script file, remove matching SessionStart hook entry

4. **Modified command registration**: Add `--no-gh-cli` option to setup command.
   When present, set `use_gh_cli: false` in config before running setup.

### Idempotency Strategy

**Script file**: Compare content. Write only if missing or different.

**Hook entry**: The project `.claude/settings.json` SessionStart array may contain
multiple entries (tbd's and others). To be idempotent:
- When adding: check if any existing SessionStart entry has a command matching
  `ensure-gh-cli`. If yes, skip. If no, append.
- When removing: filter out any SessionStart entry whose command matches
  `ensure-gh-cli`. If the SessionStart array becomes empty, remove the key.

This follows the same pattern used for cleaning up legacy hooks in setup.ts
(see `LEGACY_TBD_HOOK_PATTERNS`).

### Integration with Existing Hook Management

The current `installClaudeSetup()` merges `CLAUDE_PROJECT_HOOKS` into project
settings using spread:
```typescript
projectSettings.hooks = {
  ...existingProjectHooks,
  ...CLAUDE_PROJECT_HOOKS.hooks,
};
```

This overwrites the entire `PostToolUse` key. For SessionStart, we need to be more
careful since both the gh CLI hook and potentially other hooks may coexist.
The approach should be:
1. After the spread merge, handle SessionStart separately
2. Check if gh CLI hook already exists in SessionStart array
3. Add or remove as needed

Alternatively, add the gh CLI hook entry to `CLAUDE_PROJECT_HOOKS` conditionally
based on the config setting, before the merge. This is simpler but means the merge
logic handles it.

**Recommended approach**: Handle gh CLI hook as a separate step after the main hook
merge, using explicit array manipulation. This keeps the logic clear and avoids
coupling with the existing merge.

## Stage 3: Refine Architecture

### Existing Components to Reuse

1. **`TBD_SESSION_SCRIPT` / `TBD_CLOSE_PROTOCOL_SCRIPT` pattern** - Embed script as
   string constant, write with `writeFile`, chmod 755
2. **`installClaudeSetup()` method** - Already handles project `.claude/settings.json`
   read/write/merge
3. **`LEGACY_TBD_HOOK_PATTERNS` cleanup** - Pattern for finding and removing hooks by
   command string matching
4. **`readConfig()` / `writeConfig()`** - Config persistence with Zod validation
5. **`pathExists()`** - File existence check utility

### Simplification Decisions

1. No migration needed - `use_gh_cli` defaults to `true` when missing, which is the
   desired default behavior
2. No need for a separate handler class - this integrates into existing
   `SetupClaudeHandler`
3. Script content is embedded as a constant, not read from a file at runtime
4. No version tracking for the script - always overwrite with current version
   (matches tbd-session.sh behavior)

## Open Questions

1. **Script location**: `.claude/scripts/` (project-local) vs `~/.claude/scripts/`
   (global). Project-local is better because different projects may want different
   settings. The hook reference uses a relative path (`bash .claude/scripts/...`)
   which works for project-local.

   **Decision**: Project-local `.claude/scripts/ensure-gh-cli.sh`.

2. **Should `.claude/scripts/` be gitignored?** Currently `.claude/.gitignore` only
   ignores `*.bak`. The scripts directory contains generated files but also
   potentially user-edited scripts. For now, keep it tracked in git (not gitignored)
   so team members benefit from the hook without running setup.

   **Decision**: Keep tracked in git. The script is idempotent and safe to commit.

3. **Should the hook entry be in project or global settings?** Global would apply
   to all projects. Project-local allows per-project control.

   **Decision**: Project-local, matching the PostToolUse hook pattern.
