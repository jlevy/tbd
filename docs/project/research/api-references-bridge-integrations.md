- Manage issues, assignees, comments, labels, and milestones

- Every pull request is considered an issue (but not vice versa)

- Identify pull requests by the `pull_request` key in responses

- Recent updates (2025) added REST API support for issue types

**Important Endpoints**:

- List issues: `GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues`

- Create issue: `POST /repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues`

- Update issue: `PATCH /repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/{issue_number}`

- Issue comments: `GET/POST /repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/{issue_number}/comments`

- Issue types: https://docs.github.com/en/rest/orgs/issue-types

**Assessment**: REST API is mature, well-documented, and suitable for most CRUD
operations on issues.
Rate limits apply based on authentication type.

---

#### 1.2 GitHub GraphQL API

**Status**: Complete

**Official Documentation**: https://docs.github.com/en/graphql/reference/queries

**Key Features**:

- More precise and flexible queries than REST API

- Returns only requested data (no over-fetching)

- Single endpoint for all operations

- Recent update (2025): Advanced search with AND/OR keywords and nested searches

**Breaking Changes Effective 2026**:

- `ReviewRequest.requestedBy` → use `requestedByActor` (effective 2026-04-01)

- `NotificationThread.list` → use `optionalList` (effective 2026-01-01)

- `NotificationThread.subject` → use `optionalSubject` (effective 2026-01-01)

**Query Structure**:

- Queries operate like GET requests

- Mutations operate like POST/PATCH/DELETE

- Must specify nested subfields until reaching scalars

**Related Documentation**:

- Forming calls: https://docs.github.com/en/graphql/guides/forming-calls-with-graphql

  https://docs.github.com/en/graphql/overview/rate-limits-and-query-limits-for-the-graphql-api

- Changelog: https://docs.github.com/en/graphql/overview/changelog

**Assessment**: GraphQL is ideal for complex queries requiring specific fields or
relationships. More efficient for bandwidth but requires learning GraphQL query syntax.

---

#### 1.3 GitHub Webhooks

**Status**: Complete

**Official Documentation**: https://docs.github.com/en/webhooks

**Key Features**:

- Subscribe to specific events on GitHub (push, issues, pull requests, etc.)

- Real-time HTTP POST notifications to your server

- No polling required - event-driven architecture

- Support for repository, organization, and GitHub App webhooks

**Webhook Types**:

- Repository webhooks: Require owner/admin access

- Organization webhooks: Require org owner status

- GitHub App webhooks: Tied to app permissions

**Best Practices**:

- Server must respond with 2XX within 10 seconds

- Use async queue for processing payloads

- Verify SSL certificates (enabled by default)

- Secure webhook URLs (they contain secrets)

- Maximum 20 webhooks per event type per repository

**Common Use Cases**:

---

#### 1.4 GitHub App Authentication

**Status**: Complete

**Official Documentation**:
https://docs.github.com/en/apps/creating-github-apps/authenticating-with-a-github-app/about-authentication-with-a-github-app

**Authentication Types**:

1. **JWT (JSON Web Token)** - Authenticate as the app itself
   - Required to generate installation access tokens

   - Used for app-level operations (list installations, suspend installations)

   - Short-lived tokens

2. **Installation Access Tokens** - Authenticate as an app installation
   - Required for most API operations on behalf of installation

   - Expire after 1 hour

   - Can specify subset of permissions

   - Ideal for automation workflows

3. **User Access Tokens** - OAuth tokens with fine-grained permissions
   - User + app combined permissions (intersection)

   - No traditional OAuth scopes, uses fine-grained permissions

**Bot User**:

- GitHub Apps automatically get a bot user account

- Bot user ID format: `https://api.github.com/users/<app-slug>[bot]`

- Example: Dependabot user ID is 49699333

**Token Generation Flow**:

1. Generate JWT using app private key

2. POST to `/app/installations/{installation_id}/access_tokens` with JWT

3. Receive installation access token (valid 1 hour)

4. Use token in Authorization header for API calls

**SDK Benefits**:

- Octokit SDK handles JWT generation automatically

- Manages token rotation and expiration

**Related Documentation**:

- Generating installation tokens:
  https://docs.github.com/en/apps/creating-github-apps/authenticating-with-a-github-app/generating-an-installation-access-token-for-a-github-app

- Authenticating as app:
  https://docs.github.com/en/apps/creating-github-apps/authenticating-with-a-github-app/authenticating-as-a-github-app

- Authenticating as installation:
  https://docs.github.com/en/apps/creating-github-apps/authenticating-with-a-github-app/authenticating-as-a-github-app-installation

**Assessment**: Three-tier authentication model is flexible but complex.
Installation tokens with 1-hour expiry require refresh logic.
Use SDK to simplify.

#### 1.5 GitHub App Permissions and Webhooks

**Status**: Complete

**Official Documentation**:
https://docs.github.com/en/apps/creating-github-apps/registering-a-github-app/choosing-permissions-for-a-github-app

**Key Concepts**:

- Apps have no permissions by default

- Webhook event subscriptions depend on permissions granted

- Must request minimum required permissions

**Permission → Webhook Example**:

- To receive `issues` webhook events:
  1. First grant “Issues” permission under “Repository permissions”

  2. Then subscribe to “Issues” events under “Subscribe to events”

**OAuth Scopes Required**:

- Repository webhooks: `write:repo_hook` or `repo` scope

- Organization webhooks: `admin:org_hook` scope

**Best Practices**:

- Request minimum permissions required

- Explain high-level permissions (e.g., “Administration”) on app homepage

- Users must understand why broad permissions are needed

**Related Documentation**:

- Using webhooks with GitHub Apps:
  https://docs.github.com/en/apps/creating-github-apps/registering-a-github-app/using-webhooks-with-github-apps

- OAuth scopes:
  https://docs.github.com/en/apps/oauth-apps/building-oauth-apps/scopes-for-oauth-apps

**Assessment**: Permission model is granular and security-focused.
Clear documentation needed for users about why specific permissions are required.

### 2. Slack APIs

#### 2.1 Slack Events API

**Status**: Complete

**Official Documentation**: https://docs.slack.dev/apis/events-api/

**Key Features**:

- Recommended over legacy RTM API for most use cases

- HTTP-based event delivery to your server endpoints

- Near real-time event notifications

- OAuth scope-based access control

- No WebSocket connection management required (unlike RTM)

**How It Works**:

- Set up HTTP endpoint on your server

- Subscribe to specific event types (message.channels, file_created, etc.)

- Slack POSTs events to your endpoint when they occur

- Events tied to OAuth scopes (e.g., `files:read` scope required for file events)

**Event Types**:

- Workspace events (app installation, token revocation)

- Message events (messages posted, edited, deleted)

- File events (uploaded, shared, deleted)

- User events (status changes, profile updates)

- Channel events (created, renamed, archived)

**Rate Limits**:

- 30,000 event deliveries per hour per workspace

**OAuth and Permissions**:

- Events require corresponding OAuth scopes

- Bot user requires `bot` OAuth scope

- Workspace events available through app subscriptions

**Related Documentation**:

- Main Events API: https://api.slack.com/apis/events-api

- Event types: https://api.slack.com/events

- Comparing HTTP & Socket Mode:
  https://docs.slack.dev/apis/events-api/comparing-http-socket-mode/

**Assessment**: Events API is the modern, recommended approach for receiving Slack
events. Requires publicly accessible HTTP endpoint or use Socket Mode for
firewall/security scenarios.

---

#### 2.2 Slack Socket Mode

**Status**: Complete

**Official Documentation**: https://docs.slack.dev/apis/events-api/using-socket-mode/

**Key Features**:

- WebSocket-based alternative to HTTP endpoints

- No public HTTP endpoint required (firewall-friendly)

- Uses Events API and interactive features over WebSocket

- Bidirectional stateful protocol with low latency

- Dynamic WebSocket URLs (created at runtime, not static)

**How It Works**:

1. Create app-level token with `connections:write` scope

2. Enable Socket Mode in app settings

3. Call `apps.connections.open` to get WebSocket URL

4. Connect to WebSocket (URL valid for 30 seconds)

5. URLs refresh regularly (not static)

**Connection Limits**:

- Up to 10 concurrent WebSocket connections per app

- Payloads distributed across active connections

**SDK Support**:

- **Python**: `slack_sdk.socket_mode.SocketModeClient`

- **JavaScript (Node.js)**: `@slack/socket-mode` package (Node v18+)

- **Java**: `bolt-socket-mode` extension (since v1.5)

**Use Cases**:

- Development behind corporate firewalls

- Security concerns about exposing public endpoints

- Local development without ngrok/tunneling

**Related Documentation**:

- Main Socket Mode guide: https://docs.slack.dev/apis/events-api/using-socket-mode/

endpoints are not feasible.
Slightly more complex than webhooks but more flexible for certain deployment scenarios.

---

#### 2.3 Slack Real Time Messaging (RTM) API

**Status**: Legacy (Not Recommended)

**Official Documentation**: https://api.slack.com/rtm

**Important Notice**:

- **LEGACY API** - Slack recommends Events API or Socket Mode instead

- New classic apps cannot be created after June 4, 2024

- Many workspace admins block RTM due to overly permissive scopes

- Requires broader permissions than modern alternatives

**How It Works**:

- WebSocket-based API for real-time events

- Call `rtm.connect` to get WebSocket URL

- Single-use URLs valid for 30 seconds

- Receives event stream over WebSocket

**Why Avoid**:

- Requires overly permissive OAuth scopes

- Less secure than modern alternatives

- Not supported for new apps

- Better alternatives exist (Socket Mode for WebSockets, Events API for HTTP)

**Migration Path**:

- **For WebSockets**: Use Socket Mode instead

- **For HTTP**: Use Events API instead

**Related Documentation**:

- Legacy RTM API: https://api.slack.com/legacy/rtm

- Node.js RTM SDK: https://docs.slack.dev/tools/node-slack-sdk/rtm-api/

- Python RTM SDK:

---

## Recommendations

### Summary

For TBD bridge integrations, use modern, well-supported APIs and protocols:

- **GitHub**: REST API for CRUD, GraphQL for complex queries, webhooks for real-time
  updates

- **Slack**: Events API or Socket Mode (avoid RTM), Bolt framework for app development

- **Storage**: YAML frontmatter + Markdown (like tk) for human readability, with
  optional SQLite cache

- **Multi-agent**: A2A protocol for coordination, hierarchical orchestration pattern

### Recommended Approach

#### GitHub Bridge Architecture

1. **Authentication**: GitHub App with installation tokens
   - Use Octokit SDK for token management

   - Implement token refresh service

   - Store private key in secure vault

2. **API Layer**: Hybrid REST/GraphQL
   - REST for issue CRUD operations

   - GraphQL for bulk queries and complex relationships

   - Cache frequently-accessed data

3. **Webhook Handling**: Async queue processing
   - Receive webhook on endpoint

   - Validate signature

   - Queue for async processing

   - Respond within 10 seconds

   - Process event and sync to TBD

4. **Sync Strategy**: Bidirectional with conflict detection
   - GitHub → TBD: Real-time via webhooks

   - TBD → GitHub: On local commit

   - Detect conflicts, notify user for resolution

#### Slack Bridge Architecture

1. **Connection**: Socket Mode for development, Events API for production
   - Use Bolt framework (Python or JavaScript)

   - Handle reconnections gracefully

   - Implement rate limiting

2. **Event Handling**: Subscribe to relevant events
   - Message events for new issues/comments

   - User events for @mentions

   - File events for attachments

   - App events for lifecycle management

3. **Commands**: Slash commands for common operations
   - `/tbd create` - Create new task

   - `/tbd list` - List open tasks

   - `/tbd assign` - Assign task

   - `/tbd status` - Update task status

4. **Notifications**: Rich message formatting
   - Use Block Kit for structured messages

   - Thread related notifications

   - Add action buttons for common operations

   - Support ephemeral messages for errors

#### TBD Storage Format

**Recommended**: Hybrid approach inspired by tk and Beads

1. **Primary Storage**: Markdown files with YAML frontmatter

   ```markdown

   id: task-123
   title: Implement GitHub bridge
   status: in-progress
   assignee: @user
   created: 2026-01-08T10:00:00Z
   updated: 2026-01-08T15:30:00Z

   ---

   # Description

   Implement bidirectional sync between TBD and GitHub Issues...

   # Discussion

   - Comment 1...
   - Comment 2...
   ```

2. **Optional Cache**: SQLite for performance
   - Index tasks by status, assignee, tags

   - Enable fast queries without parsing all files

   - Rebuild from git on startup

   - Invalidate on git pull

3. **Git Structure**: Use dedicated branch or refs
   - Option A: `.tbd/` directory on main branch

   - Option B: Separate `tbd-tasks` branch

   - Option C: Git refs like `refs/tbd/tasks` (like git-bug)

**Rationale**:

- Markdown + YAML is human-readable and AI-friendly

- Git native with full version history

- Optional cache doesn’t compromise git-native approach

- Flexible querying with cache, transparent without

#### Multi-Agent Coordination

**Recommended**: Hierarchical A2A with router pattern

1. **Agent Roles**:
   - **Router Agent**: Receives user requests, delegates to specialists

   - **GitHub Bridge Agent**: Handles GitHub sync

   - **Slack Bridge Agent**: Handles Slack notifications

   - **Git Agent**: Performs git operations

   - **Query Agent**: Handles search and reporting

2. **Communication Protocol**: A2A with JSON-RPC
   - Agent capability cards describe what each agent can do

   - Router consults cards to delegate tasks

   - Agents communicate via JSON-RPC messages

   - Correlation IDs for request tracing

3. **Orchestration**: Event-driven with pub-sub
   - Central event bus for agent coordination

   - Agents subscribe to relevant event types

   - Loose coupling between agents

   - Easy to add new agents

4. **Reliability**: Human-in-the-loop for critical operations
   - Agent proposes changes

   - User reviews and approves

   - Audit log of all operations

   - Rollback capability

**Rationale**:

- A2A is emerging standard for enterprise multi-agent systems

- Hierarchical reduces communication complexity

- Pub-sub enables loose coupling

- Human-in-the-loop ensures control and auditability

### Alternative Approaches

#### Alternative 1: Centralized Server Architecture

**When Appropriate**:

- Team needs web UI for task management

- Real-time collaboration is priority

- Complex querying requirements

**Tradeoffs**:

- ❌ Loses git-native benefits

- ❌ Requires server infrastructure

- ✅ Easier real-time sync

- ✅ Better performance for large datasets

#### Alternative 2: Pure Git Objects (like git-bug)

**When Appropriate**:

- Deeply technical users

- No need for human readability

- Want cleanest git history

**Tradeoffs**:

- ❌ Less human-readable

- ❌ Harder to edit manually

- ✅ Cleanest git approach

- ✅ Better separation from codebase

#### Alternative 3: Monolithic Agent vs Multi-Agent

**When Appropriate**:

- Simple use cases

- Small team

- Limited bridge requirements

**Tradeoffs**:

- ❌ Less scalable

- ❌ Harder to extend

- ✅ Simpler architecture

- ✅ Faster initial development

# Description

Implement webhook handler to receive real-time updates from GitHub Issues API. Handler should:

- Validate webhook signature
- Queue event for async processing
- Respond within 10 seconds
- Support all relevant event types

# Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Webhook endpoint receives and validates events
- [ ] Signature verification implemented
- [ ] Async queue processing in place
- [ ] Response time < 5 seconds
- [ ] All issue events handled (created, updated, closed, etc.)
- [ ] Integration tests passing
- [ ] Deployment documentation updated

# Discussion

**@alice** (2026-01-08 10:15):
Starting with webhook validation. Using GitHub's signature verification approach with HMAC-SHA256.

**@bob** (2026-01-08 12:30):
Consider using Redis for the async queue. We already have it for other services.

**@alice** (2026-01-08 13:00):
Good idea. Will use Bull queue library with Redis backend.

# Technical Notes

## Webhook Signature Verification

```python
import hmac
import hashlib

def verify_signature(payload, signature, secret):
    expected = 'sha256=' + hmac.new(
        secret.encode(),
        payload,
        hashlib.sha256
    ).hexdigest()
    return hmac.compare_digest(expected, signature)
```
````

## Event Processing Flow

1. Receive webhook POST

2. Verify signature

3. Add to queue with correlation ID

4. Return 200 OK

5. Worker processes event async

6. Update TBD task

7. Log result
