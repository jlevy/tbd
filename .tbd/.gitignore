# ============================================================================
# IMPORTANT: workspaces/ must NEVER be gitignored!
#
# The workspaces/ directory (including workspaces/outbox/) stores issue data
# that could not be pushed to the tbd-sync branch (e.g. due to HTTP 403 in
# restricted environments like Claude Code). The ENTIRE POINT of this
# directory is that it gets committed to your working branch so the data
# survives across sessions and can be synced later.
#
# Gitignoring workspaces/ would CAUSE DATA LOSS -- unsynced issues would be
# silently discarded on checkout. Do NOT add workspaces/ to any .gitignore.
