When doctor finds orphaned dependencies, duplicate IDs, or invalid issues, it should list the specific items instead of just showing counts.

**Current behavior:**
```
⚠ Dependencies - 2 orphaned reference(s)
✗ Unique IDs - 1 duplicate ID(s)  
✗ Issue validity - 3 invalid issue(s)
```

**Expected behavior:**
```
⚠ Dependencies - 2 orphaned reference(s)
    tbd-abc1 -> tbd-xyz9 (missing)
    tbd-def2 -> tbd-uvw8 (missing)
✗ Unique IDs - 1 duplicate ID(s)
    tbd-1234 appears in: open/issue1.md, closed/issue2.md
✗ Issue validity - 3 invalid issue(s)
    tbd-aaa1: missing required field 'title'
    tbd-bbb2: invalid priority 5 (must be 0-4)
    tbd-ccc3: invalid ID format
```

**Implementation:**
- Add `details?: string[]` field to CheckResult interface
- Update checkOrphanedDependencies, checkDuplicateIds, checkIssueValidity to populate details
- Render details as indented lines below the check result
