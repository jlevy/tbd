title: Fix column alignment for short bead IDs in pretty output
type: is

When bead IDs have short suffixes (3 or fewer characters after the prefix, e.g., ar-0m1, ar-4ob, ar-80u), the columns in `tbd list --pretty` output don't align properly.

The ID column width should be fixed/padded so all columns align regardless of ID length.

Example of misalignment:
```
ar-6n5z  P0  ○ open  [bug] ...
ar-0m1  P2  ○ open  [feature] ...   <- misaligned
ar-80u  P2  ○ open  [feature] ...   <- misaligned
```

Fix: Left-pad or right-pad the ID field to a consistent width in the table formatting code.
