close_reason: Added repairWorktree() function to git.ts. Handles prunable (git worktree prune), corrupted (backup + remove), and missing states. Calls initWorktree() to recreate. Updated sync.ts to use it.

Add repairWorktree() to git.ts. Follows decision tree from spec Appendix E: prune if prunable, create from local/remote/orphan based on branch state. Uses existing initWorktree() after cleanup. Location: packages/tbd/src/file/git.ts
