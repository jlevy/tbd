If a user manually removes a pattern we manage (like docs/), we re-add it on next setup. This is intentional because: 1) docs/ is regenerated from npm package on every setup, 2) These are tool-managed files, not user-authored, 3) Tracking them would cause noise on every upgrade. Should add a comment in setup.ts explaining this design decision.
