During sync operations, we already know which issues are being modified. The approach:

1. In commitWorktreeChanges() or its caller, track which issues were created/updated/deleted
2. Pass this list of Issue objects to the commit message generator
3. The caller (sync command) already has access to issues via listIssues() and knows what changed

Key files:
- sync.ts: commitWorktreeChanges() method (line ~272)
- The sync operation knows the issues - just need to pass them through

No git parsing needed - we track the issues as we're writing them.
