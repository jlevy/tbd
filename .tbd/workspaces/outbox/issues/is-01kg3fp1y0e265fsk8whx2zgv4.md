close_reason: Fixed getSyncStatus() to check worktree status instead of main branch. Changed git status to run with -C worktreePath to check uncommitted changes in the correct location.

Fix Bug 2: getSyncStatus() at sync.ts:140 runs 'git status --porcelain DATA_SYNC_DIR' on main branch where data-sync is gitignored. Change to check files in worktree path via resolveDataSyncDir(). Location: packages/tbd/src/cli/commands/sync.ts:128-218
