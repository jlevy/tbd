title: Fix sync that committed unresolved merge conflicts

The sync code resolves conflicts for issue files but ignores ids.yml. When ids.yml has conflicts, it gets staged and committed with conflict markers.

Fix needed:
1. Add merge resolution for ids.yml (combine all key-value pairs from both sides)
2. Add merge resolution for any other YAML files in data-sync

Safety check added (temporary): Sync now detects conflict markers before committing and fails loudly. This prevents silent corruption but doesn't resolve the root cause.
