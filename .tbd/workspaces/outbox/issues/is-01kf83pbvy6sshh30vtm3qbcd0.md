## Notes

After the refactoring to use SKILL.md as single source of truth, review setup.ts for any remaining hardcoded content. The following are now dynamically loaded from SKILL.md: Cursor rules content, Codex AGENTS.md tbd section. Check if there are other hardcoded instructions or patterns that should come from a central source.
