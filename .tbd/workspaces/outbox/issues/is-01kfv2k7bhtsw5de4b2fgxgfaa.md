Create .claude/.gitignore to ignore backup files like settings.json.bak.

This is the first real-world use of ensureGitignorePatterns() - use it to:
1. Create .claude/.gitignore if it doesn't exist
2. Add '*.bak' pattern idempotently

This task serves as validation that the new utility works correctly.
