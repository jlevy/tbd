title: Include YAML frontmatter in source SKILL.md file

Move the YAML frontmatter from setup.ts into the source docs/SKILL.md file.

Current state:
- docs/SKILL.md contains just the markdown content
- setup.ts has SKILL_FRONTMATTER constant that gets prepended
- The installed .claude/skills/tbd/SKILL.md has frontmatter

Target state:
- docs/SKILL.md includes the YAML frontmatter at the top:
  ```yaml
  ---
  name: tbd
  description: Git-native issue tracking for AI agents...
  allowed-tools: Bash(tbd:*), Read, Write
  ---
  ```
- setup.ts simply copies the file as-is (no prepending)
- `tbd prime` outputs the full content including YAML (this is fine)

Benefits:
- Single source of truth for skill content
- Easier to edit and maintain
- Standard skill file format in the repo
- Removes code duplication in setup.ts
