Create comprehensive unit tests for the ensureGitignorePatterns() edit function.

Test cases:
- Create new file: returns { created: true, added: [...], skipped: [] }
- Append to existing: preserves existing content, adds new patterns
- Idempotent: running twice produces same result, second run has skipped patterns
- With header: header comment is added before patterns
- Preserves user patterns: existing user-added patterns not lost
- Atomic write: verify atomically.writeFile() is used
- Mixed new/existing: some patterns added, some skipped
