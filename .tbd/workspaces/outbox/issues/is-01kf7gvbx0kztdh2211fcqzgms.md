Currently tbd doctor just shows checkmarks without details. It should show the exact paths verified for each check. For example:

Current:
✓ Config file
✓ Claude Code skill

Should be:
✓ Config file (.tbd/config.yml)
✓ Claude Code skill (.claude/skills/tbd/SKILL.md)

When checks fail, show what path was expected but not found.
