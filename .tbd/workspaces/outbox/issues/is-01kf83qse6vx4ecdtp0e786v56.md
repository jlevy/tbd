title: Parse git status to identify modified issue files and extract issue IDs

In commitWorktreeChanges(), after getting git status output, parse it to:
1. Filter for issue files (.tbd/data-sync/issues/*.md)
2. Extract the internal issue ID from each file path
3. Determine the action (new/modified/deleted) from status code
4. Return structured data with issue IDs and their actions

Use parseGitStatus from syncSummary.ts as reference.
