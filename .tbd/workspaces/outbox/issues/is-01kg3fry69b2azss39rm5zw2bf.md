close_reason: "Added e2e tryscript test cli-sync-worktree-scenarios.tryscript.md covering 17 test cases: fresh init (worktree created, issues in correct location), worktree deleted (sync --fix repairs), data in wrong location (doctor --fix migrates). Also fixed repairWorktree to prune for 'missing' status."

Implement the e2e tryscript test from spec Appendix (test-sync-worktree-scenarios.sh). Tests all 5 scenarios: fresh init, fresh clone, worktree deleted, never initialized, never pushed. Uses local bare repo for isolation.
