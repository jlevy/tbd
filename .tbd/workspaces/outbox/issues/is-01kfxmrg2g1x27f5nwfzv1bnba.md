In setup.ts:1159, we always print 'Created .tbd/.gitignore' but ensureGitignorePatterns returns { added, skipped, created } which tells us exactly what happened. Should show: Created (new file), Updated (patterns added), or nothing (already up to date). Location: packages/tbd/src/cli/commands/setup.ts#L1142-1159
