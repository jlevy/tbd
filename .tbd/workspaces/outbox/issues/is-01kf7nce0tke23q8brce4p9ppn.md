The `tbd setup codex --check` command should show the full file path being checked.

**Current behavior:**
```
⚠ AGENTS.md exists but no tbd section found
  Run: tbd setup codex (to add tbd section)
```

or:
```
AGENTS.md not found
  Run: tbd setup codex
```

**Expected behavior:**
```
⚠ AGENTS.md exists but no tbd section found (./AGENTS.md)
  Run: tbd setup codex
```

or:
```
✗ AGENTS.md not found
    Expected: ./AGENTS.md
    Run: tbd setup codex
```

**Implementation:**
- Update checkCodexSetup() to include path in all output messages
- Use consistent format with other diagnostic commands
