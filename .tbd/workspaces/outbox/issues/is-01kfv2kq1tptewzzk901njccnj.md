title: Unit tests for hasGitignorePattern()

Create comprehensive unit tests for the hasGitignorePattern() detection function.

Test cases:
- Exact match: 'foo/' found in content with 'foo/'
- Normalized match: 'foo' found in content with 'foo/'
- No match: 'bar' not found in content with 'foo/'
- Skip comments: pattern not matched against '#foo/' comment lines
- Skip blank lines: empty lines don't affect matching
- Case sensitivity: 'FOO' does not match 'foo'
- Multiple patterns: correct detection among many lines
