close_reason: "Added CI health check as integration test in worktree-health.test.ts (2 new tests): verifies checkWorktreeHealth returns valid after initWorktree, and worktree remains healthy after creating issues. Per user feedback, moved from GitHub Action to regular test suite."

title: "Add CI check: worktree health after operations"

Add CI step that runs 'tbd doctor' after test operations and fails if unhealthy. Ensures worktree integrity is maintained in CI pipeline.
