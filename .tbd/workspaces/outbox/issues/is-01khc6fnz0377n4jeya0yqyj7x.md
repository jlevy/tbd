Review Section 10 (lines 1096-1597): Self-Managed Compaction and Agent Self-Restart. This is the longest section (8 approaches). (1) Verify auto-compaction behavior (95% trigger, progressive loss claims). (2) Verify CLAUDE_AUTOCOMPACT_PCT_OVERRIDE works. (3) Check status of SessionStart compact hook bug (Issue #15174). (4) Verify all 8 approaches are still viable. (5) Research: Look for new compaction/handoff projects — claude-handoff, claude-code-handoff, Continuous-Claude-v3, context recovery hooks. (6) Search for emerging patterns around agent memory, state persistence, and session continuity across the broader ecosystem.
