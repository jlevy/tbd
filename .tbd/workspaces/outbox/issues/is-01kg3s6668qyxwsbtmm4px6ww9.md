title: "Bug: worktree commit operations should bypass parent repo git hooks"

When migrateDataToWorktree commits files in the worktree, the commit can fail due to lefthook (or other git hooks) from the parent repo. Worktree commit operations in git.ts should use --no-verify to bypass hooks, since the worktree is an internal data store and shouldn't be subject to project-level hooks like linting.

Observed in ai-trade-arena recovery: migration commit failed with 'No config files with names [lefthook] have been found'.

Fix: Add --no-verify to git commit calls in migrateDataToWorktree() and other worktree operations.
