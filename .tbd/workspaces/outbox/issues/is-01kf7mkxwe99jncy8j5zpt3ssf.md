Create lib/truncate.ts with:
- ELLIPSIS constant (… U+2026) - never use '...'
- truncate(text, maxLength, options?) - truncate with word boundary support
- truncateMiddle(text, maxLength) - truncate from middle (for paths/IDs)
- Unit tests for all edge cases (empty, exact length, unicode, etc.)

Reference: plan spec section 2.4 (Truncation utility)
