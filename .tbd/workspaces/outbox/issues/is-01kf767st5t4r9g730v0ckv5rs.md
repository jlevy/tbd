close_reason: "Added git-remote.test.ts with integration tests for: worktree initialization (orphan, reuse, from local branch), sync with remote (push, verify remote branch, local commits), merge algorithm (LWW, union, concurrent creation), and large repository performance (5000+ issues). Tests use local bare repos to simulate remotes."
