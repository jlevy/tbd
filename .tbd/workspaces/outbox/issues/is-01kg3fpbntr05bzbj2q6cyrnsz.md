title: Audit sync.ts for hardcoded DATA_SYNC_DIR/WORKTREE_DIR usage

Review all sync operations for hardcoded WORKTREE_DIR or DATA_SYNC_DIR usage. All data paths MUST go through resolveDataSyncDir(). Only exception: worktree creation/repair in git.ts. Document findings and fix any remaining hardcoded paths. Location: packages/tbd/src/cli/commands/sync.ts
