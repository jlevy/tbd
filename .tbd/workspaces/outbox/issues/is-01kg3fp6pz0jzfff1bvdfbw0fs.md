close_reason: Updated commitWorktreeChanges() and fullSync() to use this.tbdRoot instead of process.cwd() for consistent path resolution. Also updated getSyncStatus() to use tbdRoot.

Fix Bug 1: commitWorktreeChanges() uses hardcoded join(process.cwd(), WORKTREE_DIR) at line 273. Should derive worktree path from this.dataSyncDir. Same issue in fullSync() at line 427. Location: packages/tbd/src/cli/commands/sync.ts:272-308, 423-594
