title: Add Claude Code skill for tbd (SKILL.md)

Create a Claude Code skill file at .claude/skills/tbd/SKILL.md that provides tbd workflow instructions. The skill should cover the same content as tbd prime but formatted for the skill system.

## Implementation
- Created .claude/skills/tbd/SKILL.md with:
  - YAML frontmatter (name, description, allowed-tools)
  - Session close protocol
  - Core rules
  - Essential commands tables
  - Common workflows
  - Setup commands reference

## Relationship to tbd-wt20
Once tbd-wt20 (move prime to docs/tbd-prime.md) is complete, we could potentially share content between the prime doc and this skill to avoid duplication.
