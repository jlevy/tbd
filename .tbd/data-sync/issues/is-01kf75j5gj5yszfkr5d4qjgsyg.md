title: Move issue tally counts from tbd status to tbd stats

Currently `tbd status` shows issue counts (Ready, In progress, Open, Total). These should be moved to `tbd stats` so that:
- `tbd stats` is focused on issue statistics and metrics
- `tbd status` is focused on integration, configuration, and setup status

This makes the commands more focused and easier to understand.
