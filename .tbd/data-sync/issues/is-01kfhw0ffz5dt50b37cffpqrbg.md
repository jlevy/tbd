close_reason: "Implemented: DocCache has calculateScore() with SCORE_EXACT_MATCH, SCORE_PREFIX_MATCH, SCORE_CONTAINS_ALL, SCORE_PARTIAL_BASE constants"

Implement scoring in DocCache: exact filename match = 1.0, prefix match = 0.9, contains all query words = 0.8, contains some query words = 0.7 × (matched/total). No external library needed initially. Score against filename, title, and description from frontmatter.
