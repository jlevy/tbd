Restructure the shortcuts system to separate guidelines and templates from shortcuts, making them top-level commands with their own directories. Target: .tbd/docs/shortcuts/, .tbd/docs/guidelines/, .tbd/docs/templates/. New commands: tbd templates, tbd guidelines (both support --list and fuzzy search).
