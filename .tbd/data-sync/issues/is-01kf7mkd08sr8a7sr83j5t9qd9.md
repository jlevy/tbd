Systematically review and standardize all CLI output across tbd. Establish a universal CLI design system that ensures consistent output structure, formatting, colors, and conventions across all commands and output modes.

Reference: docs/project/specs/active/plan-2026-01-17-cli-output-design-system.md

Goals:
1. Document all output categories and when each should be used
2. Standardize color semantics across all output types
3. Define verbose vs debug mode boundaries clearly
4. Establish formatting conventions for tables, lists, IDs, etc.
5. Create guidelines for error messages, success messages, and progress
6. Review existing commands for compliance and fix inconsistencies
