Shortcut: Implement Spec

We track issues with tbd.
Run `tbd` for more on using tbd and current status.

Instructions:

Create a to-do list with the following items then perform all of them:

1. Review docs/general/agent-rules/ for relevant rules relevant to implementing this
   spec and docs/general/agent-guidelines/general-tdd-guidelines.md to understand all
   project and testing rules.

2. IMPORTANT: *Track all work with issues using tbd.* Use `tbd create` to create issues,
   `tbd ready` to find work, and `tbd close` when done.

3. Implement issues specified by the user, highest priority first.
   If the user did not specify which issues, check all open issues with `tbd ready`.
   Issues are usually linked to specs so be sure to find specs that are relevant (for
   that issue or an umbrella issue) for each if possible and review those specs.
   Follow all rules and workflows and follow `tbd shortcut precommit-process` to commit
   code and commit or sync issue changes after each issue.

4. Repeat this for all issues where you know how to fix them.
   If unsure about an issue let the user know at the end of all work which issues had
   problems.
