  Git-native issue tracking (beads), coding guidelines, and spec-driven planning for AI agents.
  Use for tracking issues with dependencies, creating and closing bugs, features, and tasks,
  planning specs for new features, implementing features from specs, code reviews, committing code,
  creating PRs, research briefs, and architecture docs. Invoke when user mentions: tbd, beads,
  issues, bugs, tasks, todo, tracking, specs, planning, implementation, validation, guidelines,
  shortcuts, templates, commit, or PR workflows.

# tbd Workflow

`tbd` provides git-native issue tracking combined with coding guidelines, spec-driven
workflows, and reusable shortcuts—all designed for disciplined agent-based development.

## Installation

If `tbd` is not installed, install and set up:

```bash
npm install -g tbd-git@latest
tbd setup --auto --prefix=<name>   # Fresh project (--prefix REQUIRED)
tbd setup --auto                   # Existing tbd project (prefix already set)
```

**CRITICAL: Prefix Requirement**
- **Fresh projects**: `--prefix` is REQUIRED. Ask the user what prefix they want.
- **Existing tbd projects** (`.tbd/` exists): No `--prefix` needed, just run
  `tbd setup --auto`.
- **Beads migration** (`.beads/` exists): Use `tbd setup --from-beads` (uses beads
  prefix).
- **Refresh configs**: Run `tbd setup --auto` anytime to update skill files, hooks, and
  get the latest shortcuts/guidelines/templates.

**IMPORTANT FOR AGENTS:** NEVER guess or invent a prefix.
Always ask the user first.
The prefix appears in every issue ID (e.g., `myapp-a1b2`) and is a matter of user
preference.

> **Context Recovery**: Run `tbd prime` after compaction, clear, or new session.
> Hooks auto-call this in Claude Code when .tbd/ detected.

## Agent Orientation

tbd provides four core capabilities to help users:

1. **Issue Tracking**: Track tasks, bugs, and features as lightweight “beads” stored in
   git. Never lose discovered work; maintain continuity across sessions.

2. **Coding Guidelines**: A library of best practices for TypeScript, Python, testing,
   and more. Pull them in when relevant to apply consistent quality.

3. **Spec-Driven Workflows**: Write planning specs for features, then break them into
   trackable issues and implement systematically.
   This is the recommended way to handle non-trivial features.

4. **Convenience Shortcuts**: Pre-built processes for common tasks like committing code,
   creating PRs, and reviewing code.
   Use them to work consistently.

### Why These Work Together

The power of tbd emerges when these capabilities combine:
- **Write a planning spec** → breaks down into trackable issues
- **Issues guide implementation** → guidelines ensure quality at each step
- **Shortcuts standardize processes** → consistent commits, reviews, and PRs
- **Everything stays in git** → full history, no external dependencies

### How to Use tbd to Help Users

**Don’t just tell users about commands.** Use tbd proactively:

- User describes a bug → `tbd create "Bug: ..." --type=bug`
- User wants a feature → Create a plan spec, then break into issues
- Starting a session → Check `tbd ready` for available work
- Completing work → `tbd close <id>` with clear reason
- User asks what tbd does → Explain the four capabilities above

### Quick Reference Table

| User Need | Command | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| "I found a bug" | `tbd create "..." --type=bug` | Creates issue |
| "Let's plan this feature" | `tbd shortcut new-plan-spec` | Outputs instructions |
| "What should I work on?" | `tbd ready` | Lists ready issues |
| "Build a TypeScript CLI" | `tbd guidelines typescript-cli-tool-rules` | Outputs guidelines |
| "Set up a monorepo" | `tbd guidelines typescript-monorepo-patterns` | Outputs guidelines |
| "Add golden/snapshot tests" | `tbd guidelines golden-testing-guidelines` | Outputs guidelines |
| "Review the TypeScript code" | `tbd guidelines typescript-rules` | Outputs guidelines |
| "Ready to commit" | `tbd shortcut commit-code` | Outputs instructions |

*“Outputs instructions/guidelines” = Read and follow the guidance.
It tells you HOW to do something well.*

# SESSION CLOSING PROTOCOL

**CRITICAL**: Before saying “done” or “complete”, you MUST run this checklist:

```
[ ] 1. Stage and commit: git add + git commit
[ ] 2. Push to remote: git push
[ ] 3. Start CI watch (BLOCKS until done): gh pr checks <PR> --watch 2>&1
[ ] 4. While CI runs: tbd close/update <id> for issues worked on
[ ] 5. While CI runs: tbd sync
[ ] 6. Return to step 3 and CONFIRM CI passed
[ ] 7. If CI failed: fix, re-push, restart from step 3
```

## NON-NEGOTIABLE Requirements

### CI: Wait for `--watch` to finish

The `--watch` flag blocks until ALL checks complete.
Do NOT see “passing” in early output and move on—wait for the **final summary** showing
all checks passed.

### tbd: Update issues and sync

Every session must end with tbd in a clean state:
- Close/update **every issue** you worked on
- Run `tbd sync` and confirm it completed

**Work is not done until pushed, CI passes, and tbd is synced.**

## Core Rules

- Track *all task work* not being done immediately as beads using `tbd` (discovered
  work, future work, TODOs for the session, multi-session work)
- When in doubt, prefer tbd for tracking tasks, bugs, and issues
- Use `tbd create` for creating beads
- Git workflow: update or close issues and run `tbd sync` at session end
- If not given specific directions, check `tbd ready` for available work

## Essential Commands

### Finding Work

- `tbd ready` - Show issues ready to work (no blockers)
- `tbd list --status open` - All open issues
- `tbd list --status in_progress` - Your active work
- `tbd show <id>` - Detailed issue view with dependencies

### Creating & Updating

- `tbd create "title" --type task|bug|feature --priority=P2` - New issue
  - Priority: P0-P4 (P0=critical, P2=medium, P4=backlog).
    Do NOT use "high"/"medium"/"low"
- `tbd update <id> --status in_progress` - Claim work
- `tbd update <id> --assignee username` - Assign to someone
- `tbd close <id>` - Mark complete
- `tbd close <id> --reason "explanation"` - Close with reason
- **Tip**: When creating multiple issues, use parallel subagents for efficiency

### Dependencies & Blocking

- `tbd dep add <issue> <depends-on>` - Add dependency (issue depends on depends-on)
- `tbd blocked` - Show all blocked issues
- `tbd show <id>` - See what’s blocking/blocked by this issue

### Sync & Collaboration

- `tbd sync` - Sync with git remote (run at session end)
- `tbd sync --status` - Check sync status without syncing

Note: `tbd sync` handles all git operations for issues--no manual git push needed.

### Project Health

- `tbd stats` - Project statistics (open/closed/blocked counts)
- `tbd doctor` - Check for issues (sync problems, missing hooks)

## Common Workflows

**Starting work:**

```bash
tbd ready                              # Find available work
tbd show <id>                          # Review issue details
tbd update <id> --status in_progress   # Claim it
```

**Completing work:**

```bash
tbd close <id>    # Mark complete
tbd sync          # Push to remote
```

**Creating dependent work:**

```bash
tbd create "Implement feature X" --type feature
tbd create "Write tests for X" --type task
tbd dep add <tests-id> <feature-id>   # Tests depend on feature
```

## Documentation Commands

### Shortcuts

Reusable instruction templates for common tasks:

- `tbd shortcut <name>` - Output a shortcut by name
- `tbd shortcut --list` - List all available shortcuts

### Guidelines

Coding rules and best practices:

- `tbd guidelines <name>` - Output a guideline by name
- `tbd guidelines --list` - List all available guidelines

Example: `tbd guidelines typescript-rules`

### Templates

Document templates for specs, research, architecture:

- `tbd template <name>` - Output a template by name
- `tbd template --list` - List all available templates

Example: `tbd template plan-spec > docs/project/specs/active/plan-YYYY-MM-DD-feature.md`

## Setup Commands

- `tbd setup --auto` - Non-interactive setup with smart defaults (for agents/scripts)
- `tbd setup --interactive` - Interactive setup with prompts (for humans)
- `tbd setup --from-beads` - Migrate from Beads to tbd

> **Refresh anytime:** Run `tbd setup --auto` to update skill files, hooks, and configs
> with the latest shortcuts/guidelines/templates.
> Safe to run repeatedly.

## Quick Reference

- **Priority levels**: 0=critical, 1=high, 2=medium (default), 3=low, 4=backlog
- **Issue types**: task, bug, feature, epic
- **Status values**: open, in_progress, closed
- **JSON output**: Add `--json` to any command for machine-readable output
