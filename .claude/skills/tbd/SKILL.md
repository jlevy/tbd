description: Git-native issue tracking (beads), coding guidelines, and spec-driven planning for AI agents. Use for tracking issues with dependencies, creating and closing bugs, features, and tasks, planning specs for new features, implementing features from specs, code reviews, committing code, creating PRs, research briefs, and architecture docs. Invoke when user mentions: tbd, beads, issues, bugs, tasks, todo, tracking, specs, planning, implementation, validation, guidelines, shortcuts, templates, commit, PR workflows, code review, testing best practices, or monorepo patterns.

title: tbd Workflow
description: Full tbd workflow guide for agents
---
**`tbd` helps humans and agents ship code with greater speed, quality, and discipline.**

1. **Beads**: Git-native issue tracking (tasks, bugs, features).
   Never lose work across sessions.
2. **Spec-Driven Workflows**: Plan features → break into beads → implement
   systematically.
3. **Shortcuts**: Reusable instruction templates for common workflows.
4. **Guidelines**: Coding rules and best practices.

## Installation

```bash
npm install -g get-tbd@latest
tbd setup --auto --prefix=<name>   # Fresh project (--prefix is REQUIRED and should be short. For new project setup, ALWAYS ASK THE USER FOR THE PREFIX; do not guess it)
tbd setup --auto                   # Existing tbd project (prefix already set)
tbd setup --from-beads             # Migration from .beads/ if `bd` has been used
```

## Routine Commands

```bash
tbd --help    # Command reference
tbd status    # Status
tbd doctor    # If there are problems

tbd setup --auto   # Run any time to refresh setup
tbd prime      # Restore full context on tbd after compaction
```

## CRITICAL: You Operate tbd — The User Doesn’t

**You are the tbd operator:** Users talk naturally; you translate their requests to tbd
actions. DO NOT tell users to run tbd commands.
That’s your job.

- **WRONG**: "Run `tbd create` to track this bug"

- **RIGHT**: *(you run `tbd create` yourself and tell the user it’s tracked)*

**Welcoming a user:** When users ask “what is tbd?”
or want help → run `tbd shortcut welcome-user`

## User Request → Agent Action

| User Says | You (the Agent) Run |
| --- | --- |
| "There's a bug where ..." | `tbd create "..." --type=bug` |
| "Let's work on issues" | `tbd ready` |
| "Build a TypeScript CLI" | `tbd guidelines typescript-cli-tool-rules` |
| "Improve eslint/monorepo" | `tbd guidelines typescript-monorepo-patterns` |
| "Add e2e/golden testing" | `tbd guidelines golden-testing-guidelines` |
| "Review changes" (TS) | `tbd guidelines typescript-rules` |
| "Review changes" (Python) | `tbd guidelines python-rules` |
| "Plan a new feature" | `tbd shortcut new-plan-spec` |
| "Break spec into beads" | `tbd shortcut plan-implementation-with-beads` |
| "Implement these beads" | `tbd shortcut implement-beads` |
| "Commit this" | `tbd shortcut commit-code` |
| "Create a PR" | `tbd shortcut create-or-update-pr-simple` |
| "Research this topic" | `tbd shortcut new-research-brief` |
| "Document architecture" | `tbd shortcut new-architecture-doc` |
| *(your choice whenever appropriate)* | `tbd list`, `tbd dep add`, `tbd close`, `tbd sync`, etc. |

## CRITICAL: Session Closing Protocol

**Before saying “done”, you MUST complete this checklist:**

```
[ ] 1. git add + git commit
[ ] 2. git push
[ ] 3. gh pr checks <PR> --watch 2>&1 (IMPORTANT: WAIT for final summary, do NOT tell user it is done until you confirm it passes CI!)
[ ] 4. tbd close/update <id> for all beads worked on
[ ] 5. tbd sync
[ ] 6. CONFIRM CI passed (if failed: fix, run tests, re-push, restart from step 3)
```

**Work is not done until pushed, CI passes, and tbd is synced.**

## Bead Tracking Rules

- Track all task work not done immediately as beads (discovered work, TODOs,
  multi-session work)
- When in doubt, create a bead
- Check `tbd ready` when not given specific directions
- Always close/update beads and run `tbd sync` at session end

## Commands

### Finding Work

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `tbd ready` | Beads ready to work (no blockers) |
| `tbd list --status open` | All open beads |
| `tbd list --status in_progress` | Your active work |
| `tbd show <id>` | Bead details with dependencies |

### Creating & Updating

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `tbd create "title" --type task\|bug\|feature --priority=P2` | New bead (P0-P4, not "high/medium/low") |
| `tbd update <id> --status in_progress` | Claim work |
| `tbd close <id> [--reason "..."]` | Mark complete |

### Dependencies & Sync

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `tbd dep add <bead> <depends-on>` | Add dependency |
| `tbd blocked` | Show blocked beads |
| `tbd sync` | Sync with git remote (run at session end) |
| `tbd stats` | Project statistics |
| `tbd doctor` | Check for problems |

### Documentation

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `tbd shortcut <name>` | Run a shortcut |
| `tbd shortcut --list` | List shortcuts |
