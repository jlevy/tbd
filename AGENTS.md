IMPORTANT: You MUST read ./docs/development.md and ./docs/docs-overview.md for project
documentation. (This project uses Speculate project structure.)

## Landing the Plane (Session Completion)

**When ending a work session**, you MUST complete ALL steps below.
Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds.

**MANDATORY WORKFLOW:**

1. **File issues for remaining work** - Create issues for anything that needs follow-up
2. **Run quality gates** (if code changed) - Tests, linters, builds
3. **Update issue status** - Close finished work, update in-progress items
4. **PUSH TO REMOTE** - This is MANDATORY:
   ```bash
   git pull --rebase
   bd sync
   git push
   git status  # MUST show "up to date with origin"
   ```
5. **Clean up** - Clear stashes, prune remote branches
6. **Verify** - All changes committed AND pushed
7. **Hand off** - Provide context for next session

**CRITICAL RULES:**

- Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds
- NEVER stop before pushing - that leaves work stranded locally
- NEVER say “ready to push when you are” - YOU must push
- If push fails, resolve and retry until it succeeds

# tbd Workflow

`tbd` provides lightweight, git-native task and issue tracking using beads, which are
lightweight issues managed from the CLI.

## Installation

If `tbd` is not installed, install and set up in one command:

```bash
npm install -g tbd-git@latest && tbd setup --auto
```

This initializes tbd and configures your coding agent automatically.

**IMPORTANT FOR AGENTS:** Agents should ALWAYS run `tbd setup --auto` since it is
non-interactive. Use `--interactive` for humans.
If the user wishes to migrate from `bd`, the original beads implementation, you can use
`tbd setup --from-beads`.

> **Context Recovery**: Run `tbd prime` after compaction, clear, or new session.
> Hooks auto-call this in Claude Code when .tbd/ detected.

# SESSION CLOSING PROTOCOL

**CRITICAL**: Before saying “done” or “complete”, you MUST run this checklist:

```
[ ] 1. Stage and commit: git add + git commit
[ ] 2. Push to remote: git push
[ ] 3. Start CI watch (BLOCKS until done): gh pr checks <PR> --watch 2>&1
[ ] 4. While CI runs: tbd close/update <id> for issues worked on
[ ] 5. While CI runs: tbd sync
[ ] 6. Return to step 3 and CONFIRM CI passed
[ ] 7. If CI failed: fix, re-push, restart from step 3
```

## NON-NEGOTIABLE Requirements

### CI: Wait for `--watch` to finish

The `--watch` flag blocks until ALL checks complete.
Do NOT see “passing” in early output and move on—wait for the **final summary** showing
all checks passed.

### tbd: Update issues and sync

Every session must end with tbd in a clean state:
- Close/update **every issue** you worked on
- Run `tbd sync` and confirm it completed

**Work is not done until pushed, CI passes, and tbd is synced.**

## Core Rules

- Track *all task work* not being done immediately as beads using `tbd` (discovered
  work, future work, TODOs for the session, multi-session work)
- When in doubt, prefer tbd for tracking tasks, bugs, and issues
- Use `tbd create` for creating beads
- Git workflow: update or close issues and run `tbd sync` at session end
- If not given specific directions, check `tbd ready` for available work

## Essential Commands

### Finding Work

- `tbd ready` - Show issues ready to work (no blockers)
- `tbd list --status open` - All open issues
- `tbd list --status in_progress` - Your active work
- `tbd show <id>` - Detailed issue view with dependencies

### Creating & Updating

- `tbd create "title" --type task|bug|feature --priority=P2` - New issue
  - Priority: P0-P4 (P0=critical, P2=medium, P4=backlog).
    Do NOT use "high"/"medium"/"low"
- `tbd update <id> --status in_progress` - Claim work
- `tbd update <id> --assignee username` - Assign to someone
- `tbd close <id>` - Mark complete
- `tbd close <id> --reason "explanation"` - Close with reason
- **Tip**: When creating multiple issues, use parallel subagents for efficiency

### Dependencies & Blocking

- `tbd dep add <issue> <depends-on>` - Add dependency (issue depends on depends-on)
- `tbd blocked` - Show all blocked issues
- `tbd show <id>` - See what’s blocking/blocked by this issue

### Sync & Collaboration

- `tbd sync` - Sync with git remote (run at session end)
- `tbd sync --status` - Check sync status without syncing

Note: `tbd sync` handles all git operations for issues--no manual git push needed.

### Project Health

- `tbd stats` - Project statistics (open/closed/blocked counts)
- `tbd doctor` - Check for issues (sync problems, missing hooks)

## Common Workflows

**Starting work:**

```bash
tbd ready                              # Find available work
tbd show <id>                          # Review issue details
tbd update <id> --status in_progress   # Claim it
```

**Completing work:**

```bash
tbd close <id>    # Mark complete
tbd sync          # Push to remote
```

**Creating dependent work:**

```bash
tbd create "Implement feature X" --type feature
tbd create "Write tests for X" --type task
tbd dep add <tests-id> <feature-id>   # Tests depend on feature
```
