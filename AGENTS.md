IMPORTANT: You MUST read ./docs/development.md and ./docs/docs-overview.md for project
documentation. (This project uses Speculate project structure.)

IMPORTANT: Before adding or upgrading any dependency, follow the install rules in
./SUPPLY-CHAIN-SECURITY.md (14-day cool-off, no unthinking installs, audit after each
install). Deeper background: `tbd guidelines supply-chain-hardening`.

## Landing the Plane (Session Completion)

**When ending a work session**, you MUST complete ALL steps below.
Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds.

**MANDATORY WORKFLOW:**

1. **File issues for remaining work** - Create issues for anything that needs follow-up
2. **Run quality gates** (if code changed) - Tests, linters, builds
3. **Update issue status** - Close finished work, update in-progress items
4. **PUSH TO REMOTE** - This is MANDATORY:
   ```bash
   git pull --rebase
   bd sync
   git push
   git status  # MUST show "up to date with origin"
   ```
5. **Clean up** - Clear stashes, prune remote branches
6. **Verify** - All changes committed AND pushed
7. **Hand off** - Provide context for next session

**CRITICAL RULES:**

- Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds
- NEVER stop before pushing - that leaves work stranded locally
- NEVER say “ready to push when you are” - YOU must push
- If push fails, resolve and retry until it succeeds

## tbd

This repository uses **tbd** for git-native issue tracking (beads), spec-driven
planning, and on-demand engineering guidelines.
As the agent, you operate tbd on the user’s behalf — translate their requests into tbd
actions rather than telling them to run commands.

- Run `tbd prime` to load current project state and the full tbd workflow.
- Run `tbd skill` for the complete reusable tbd skill instructions.
- Run `tbd shortcut --list` and `tbd guidelines --list` for on-demand resources.
- Track all work as beads: `tbd create`, `tbd ready`, `tbd close`, and `tbd sync`.
