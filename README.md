# tbd

**Task management, spec-driven planning, and instant knowledge injection for AI coding
agents.**

**tbd** (short for “To Be Done,” or “TypeScript beads” if you prefer) combines three
things that are each powerful on their own but unreasonably effective together:

1. **Task tracking (beads):** Agent-friendly, CLI-native issue tracking for bugs,
   features, epics, and dependencies that persist across sessions in git.
   This alone is a step change in what agents can do.
   [Beads](https://github.com/steveyegge/beads) are fantastic and *unreasonably
   effective* at scaling an agent’s capacity from ~5-10 ad-hoc tasks to hundreds of
   structured beads.
2. **Spec-driven planning:** workflows for writing specs, breaking them into beads, and
   implementing systematically.
   With a good spec and beads, you can leave an agent running overnight and come back to
   solid code.
3. **Instant knowledge injection:** Instant availability of guidelines and rules docs.
   These are essentially “self-injected context” for an agent to get smarter when it
   needs it.

tbd comes pre-installed with guideline docs on 17+ topics, like TDD, golden testing,
TypeScript and Python best practices, Convex, monorepo architecture, backward
compatibility rules.
But you can use your own if you prefer.

I use tbd most frequently in Claude Code, where it self-installs as a skill, but it will
work in Cursor, Codex, or any agent environment that can use the `tbd` CLI.

## Should You Use tbd?

If you wish, you can use tbd simply as a Beads replacement.
It’s largely compatible with `bd` at the CLI level for core issue tracking
functionality.
Its design, such as using only one sync branch and separate Markdown files
for every bead to avoid conflicts, carefully avoids some key pracctical frustrations
I’ve had with Beads (like frequent merge/sync confusions, fighting with the daemon, and
SQLite not working in Claude Code Cloud—see the [FAQ](#how-does-tbd-compare-to-beads)).

But it’s more powerful than that: the spec-driven workflows and engineering guidelines
combine with better task management to help agents ship code with speed, quality, and
discipline.

These workflows arose from several months of
[heavy spec-driven agentic coding](https://github.com/jlevy/speculate/blob/main/about/lessons_in_spec_coding.md).
Basically 100% of the code I now write is agent-written, planned and tracked through
specs and beads and streamlined with shortcuts.

tbd focuses on the *durable layer* of agent development: issue tracking, planning, and
knowledge that persist in git across sessions.
It does not (yet) try to solve real-time multi-agent coordination features of Beads or
[Gas Town](https://github.com/steveyegge/gastown) or
[Agent Mail](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/mcp_agent_mail) or unstructured agent
loops like
[Ralph Wiggum](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/tree/main/plugins/ralph-wiggum).
These seem great for rapid prototyping, but so far, code where quality or scale matters,
I’ve not fully embraced unstructured automation (e.g. 20+ concurrent agents or Ralph
loops).
I find having more process and discipline around specs (and around 6–8 concurrent
agents handling different aspects that I manage) is slower, because it forces you to
design, but it gives higher quality results.

> [!NOTE]
> We use *Beads* (capitalized) to refer to Steve Yegge’s original
> [`bd` tool](https://github.com/steveyegge/beads).
> Lowercase “beads” refers generically to the issues stored in `tbd` or `bd`.

## Quick Start

> [!TIP]
> 
> *Just tell your agent:*
> 
> ***“npm install -g get-tbd@latest and run tbd for instructions”***

That’s it. Running `tbd` with no arguments gives your agent what it needs as well as
information on how to help you.
It will then bootstraps a SKILL.md into your project by running `tbd setup --auto`
(which will add a `.tbd` directory and add itself to your `.claude` skills and hooks).
And then it will use then use shortcuts to welcome you and get you started.

You can then always ask questions like: “what can I do with tbd?”

## How to Use tbd

You talk to your agent in natural language.
The agent translates your requests into tbd commands.

The `tbd` CLI blends task tracking and context injection.
Some `tbd` commands do things, like create or update beads, and some help the agent get
status or context or knowledge and know what to do next:

| What you say | What happens | What runs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| "Let's plan a new feature that …" | Agent creates a spec from a template | `tbd shortcut new-plan-spec` |
| "Break this spec into beads" | Agent creates implementation beads from the spec | `tbd shortcut new-implementation-beads-from-spec` |
| "Implement these beads" | Agent works through beads systematically | `tbd shortcut implement-beads` |
| "Create a bead for the bug where …" | Agent creates and tracks a bead | `tbd create "..." --type=bug` |
| "Let's work on current beads" | Agent finds ready beads and starts working | `tbd ready` |
| "Code review all changes on this branch" | Agent loads language-specific review guidelines | `tbd shortcut review-code-typescript` or `tbd shortcut review-code-python` |
| "Use the shortcut to commit" | Agent runs full pre-commit checks, code review, and commits | `tbd shortcut commit-code` |
| "Create a PR" | Agent creates or updates the pull request | `tbd shortcut create-or-update-pr-simple` |
| "Let's create a research brief on …" | Agent creates a research document using a template | `tbd shortcut new-research-brief` |
| "How could we test this better?" | Agent loads TDD and testing guidelines | `tbd guidelines general-tdd-guidelines` |
| "How can we make this a well-designed TypeScript CLI?" | Agent loads TypeScript CLI guidelines | `tbd guidelines typescript-cli-tool-rules` |
| "Can you review if this TypeScript package setup follows best practices" | Agent loads monorepo patterns | `tbd guidelines typescript-monorepo-patterns` |
| "How can we do a better job of testing?" | Agent loads golden testing guidelines | `tbd guidelines golden-testing-guidelines` |

Under the hood, your agent runs these `tbd` commands automatically.
You just talk naturally.

## Features

> [!NOTE]
> For full technical details, see the [reference docs](packages/tbd/docs/tbd-docs.md)
> (run `tbd docs`) or the full [design doc](packages/tbd/docs/tbd-design.md)
> (`tbd design`).

- **Git-native:** Beads live in your repo, synced to a separate, dedicated `tbd-sync`
  branch. Your code history stays clean — no bead churn polluting your logs.
- **Agent friendly:** JSON output, non-interactive mode, simple commands that agents
  understand. Installs itself as a skill in Claude Code.
- **Markdown + YAML frontmatter:** One file per bead, human-readable and editable.
  This eliminates most merge conflicts.
- **Beads alternative:** Largely compatible with `bd` at the CLI level, but with a
  simpler architecture: no JSONL merge conflicts, no daemon modifying your working tree,
  no SQLite file locking on network filesystems (see
  [FAQ: How does tbd compare to Beads?](#how-does-tbd-compare-to-beads)).
- **Shortcuts:** Over a dozen reusable workflow documents — plan specs, code reviews,
  commit processes, PR creation, research briefs, and more.
- **Guidelines:** [17+ guideline docs](packages/tbd/docs/guidelines/) of coding rules
  and best practices (see
  [Built-in Engineering Knowledge](#built-in-engineering-knowledge)).
- **Templates:** Document templates for planning specs, research briefs, architecture
  docs.

## Why?

With the right structures, agents can often write 100% of your code.
But without structure and knowledge, the results are hit-or-miss and they don’t scale to
large projects.

Agents by nature are mediocre engineers.
They forget conventions between sessions, skip testing, and don’t follow your team’s
patterns. The usual fix—pasting rules into prompts or CLAUDE.md files—is fragile and
doesn’t scale.

Beads (git-native CLI-based issue tracking) solve the task management problem
brilliantly. If you’re not using beads already, you should be!

But task tracking alone doesn’t help with *planning* or *quality*. You still need a way
to think through what you’re building before you start, and a way to make sure the agent
follows good engineering practices while it works.

tbd combines all three: beads for task management, spec-driven workflows for planning,
and curated engineering guidelines for quality.
Together, they let you hand an agent a well-defined spec with clear beads and expert
knowledge, and get back careful, well-structured code—even overnight, even across
sessions.

My current favorite workflows and guidelines are included by default, but you’re not
locked in. Add your own via `--add` or configure what’s available in `.tbd/config.yml`.

And yes, all the code *and* all the speccs of `tbd` are agent written—see
[the FAQ](#was-tbd-built-with-tbd).

## Built-in Engineering Knowledge

When you run `tbd setup`, your agent gets instant access to
[17+ guideline documents](packages/tbd/docs/guidelines/) covering real-world engineering
practices. These aren’t generic tips — they’re detailed, opinionated rules with concrete
examples, built from months of heavy agentic coding.

**Highlights:**

Plus guidelines on [coding rules](packages/tbd/docs/guidelines/general-coding-rules.md),
[comment quality](packages/tbd/docs/guidelines/general-comment-rules.md),
[commit conventions](packages/tbd/docs/guidelines/commit-conventions.md), and
[style](packages/tbd/docs/guidelines/general-style-rules.md).

You can also add your own team’s guidelines from any URL:

```bash
tbd guidelines --add=<url> --name=my-team-rules
```

## Installation and Setup

**Requirements:**
- Node.js 20+
- Git 2.42+ (for orphan worktree support)

```bash
npm install -g get-tbd@latest
```

### Setup

```bash
# Fresh project (--prefix is REQUIRED — it appears in every bead ID, e.g. myapp-a1b2)
tbd setup --auto --prefix=myapp

# Joining an existing tbd project (no prefix needed — reads existing config)
tbd setup --auto

# Migrate from Beads (uses your existing beads prefix)
tbd setup --from-beads
```

> **Tip:** Run `tbd setup --auto` anytime to refresh skill files, hooks, and configs
> with the latest shortcuts, guidelines, and templates.

### Team Setup

tbd is designed for teams where one person sets up the project and others join later.

**First contributor:**
```bash
npm install -g get-tbd@latest
tbd setup --auto --prefix=myproject
git add .tbd/ .claude/ && git commit -m "Initialize tbd"
git push
```

**Joining contributors:**
```bash
git clone <repo>
npm install -g get-tbd@latest
tbd setup --auto                    # No --prefix needed — reads existing config
```

### Claude Code Integration

`tbd setup --auto` configures SessionStart hooks that run at the beginning of each
Claude Code session:

- **`tbd prime`** — injects workflow context so the agent knows how to use tbd
- **`ensure-gh-cli.sh`** — installs the GitHub CLI (`gh`) if not already available

**GitHub authentication:** For `gh` to work, set these environment variables before
starting your agent session:

```
GH_TOKEN=ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
GH_PROMPT_DISABLED=1
```

Create a [Personal Access Token](https://github.com/settings/tokens?type=beta)
(fine-grained recommended) with **Contents** and **Pull requests** read/write
permissions. For Claude Code Cloud, set these in your project’s environment variables.
For local CLI usage, add them to your shell profile (`~/.zshrc` or `~/.bashrc`). See
[GitHub CLI setup docs](docs/general/agent-setup/github-cli-setup.md) for details.

To disable automatic `gh` installation, pass `--no-gh-cli` during setup or set
`use_gh_cli: false` in `.tbd/config.yml` under `settings:`.

### Migrating from Beads

```bash
tbd setup --from-beads       # Auto-detects and migrates
tbd stats                    # Verify
tbd list --all
tbd setup beads --disable    # Optionally disable beads after migration
```

Issue IDs are preserved: `proj-123` in beads becomes `proj-123` in tbd.

## Commands

### Beads

```bash
tbd ready                      # Beads ready to work on (open, unblocked, unassigned)
tbd list                       # List open beads
tbd list --all                 # Include closed
tbd list --specs               # Group beads by spec
tbd show proj-a7k2             # View bead details
tbd create "Title" --type=bug  # Create bead (bug/feature/task/epic/chore)
tbd update proj-a7k2 --status=in_progress
tbd close proj-a7k2            # Close bead
tbd close proj-a7k2 --reason="Fixed in commit abc123"
tbd sync                       # Sync with remote (auto-commits and pushes)
```

### Dependencies and Labels

```bash
tbd dep add proj-b3m9 proj-a7k2        # b3m9 depends on a7k2
tbd blocked                            # Show blocked beads
tbd label add proj-a7k2 urgent backend
tbd label remove proj-a7k2 urgent
tbd label list                         # All labels in use
tbd search "authentication"            # Search beads
```

### Shortcuts, Guidelines, and Templates

tbd bundles three types of documentation your agent can invoke on demand:

```bash
# Shortcuts — workflow instructions
tbd shortcut --list              # List all shortcuts
tbd shortcut new-plan-spec       # Get the plan spec workflow

### Spec-Driven Development

For non-trivial features, tbd supports a full spec-driven workflow:

1. **Plan**: Create a planning spec (`tbd shortcut new-plan-spec`)
2. **Break down**: Convert spec into implementation beads
   (`tbd shortcut new-implementation-beads-from-spec`)
3. **Implement**: Work through beads systematically (`tbd shortcut implement-beads`)
4. **Validate**: Create validation plan, run tests (`tbd shortcut new-validation-plan`)
5. **Ship**: Commit, create PR (`tbd shortcut create-or-update-pr-with-validation-plan`)

### Maintenance

```bash
tbd status                   # Repository status (works before init too)
tbd stats                    # Bead statistics
tbd doctor                   # Check for problems
tbd doctor --fix             # Auto-fix issues
```

### Agent-Friendly Flags

Every command supports these flags for automation:

| Flag | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `--json` | Machine-parseable output |
| `--non-interactive` | Fail if input required |
| `--yes` | Auto-confirm prompts |
| `--dry-run` | Preview changes |
| `--quiet` | Minimal output |

## Documentation

```bash
tbd                          # Full orientation and workflow guidance
tbd readme                   # This file
tbd docs                     # Full CLI reference
```

Or read online:
- [CLI Reference](packages/tbd/docs/tbd-docs.md) — Complete command documentation
- [Design Doc](packages/tbd/docs/tbd-design.md) — Technical architecture

## Team Workflows

tbd is designed for teams where one person sets up the project and others join later.

**First contributor (project setup):**
```bash
npm install -g get-tbd@latest
tbd setup --auto --prefix=myproject
git add .tbd/ .claude/ && git commit -m "Initialize tbd"
git push
```

**Joining contributors:**
```bash
git clone <repo>                    # .tbd/ directory comes with repo
npm install -g get-tbd@latest       # If not already installed
tbd setup --auto                    # No --prefix needed! Reads existing config
```

The second contributor just runs `tbd setup --auto` — no need to know the project prefix
or any other configuration details.

**Updating tbd:** After upgrading tbd (`npm install -g get-tbd@latest`), run
`tbd setup --auto` to refresh local skill files with the latest shortcuts, guidelines,
and templates.

## Migration from Beads

```bash
# Auto-detects beads and migrates (uses existing beads prefix)
tbd setup --from-beads

# Verify
tbd stats
tbd list --all

# If you wish to disable beads after migration
tbd setup beads --disable
```

Issue IDs are preserved: `proj-123` in beads becomes `proj-123` in tbd.
The prefix from your beads configuration is automatically used.

## How It Works

tbd keeps two things separate from your code:

- **Beads** live on a dedicated `tbd-sync` branch.
  One Markdown file per bead means parallel creation never conflicts.
  `tbd sync` pushes changes — no manual git operations needed.
- **Documents** (shortcuts, guidelines, templates) are cached locally in `.tbd/docs/`
  during `tbd setup --auto`. Your agent reads them on demand via `tbd shortcut`,
  `tbd guidelines`, and `tbd template`. Re-run `tbd setup --auto` anytime to refresh
  with the latest bundled docs, or add your own via `--add`.
- **Everything is self-documented via the CLI.** Running `tbd` with no arguments gives
  full orientation. `tbd setup --auto` writes a skill file (SKILL.md/AGENTS.md) that
  teaches the agent all available commands, shortcuts, and guidelines.
  This means agents can inject context — specs, engineering guidelines, workflow
  instructions — at any point in a session, not just at startup.

See the [design doc](packages/tbd/docs/tbd-design.md) for details.

## FAQ

### How does tbd compare to Beads?

tbd was inspired by [Beads](https://github.com/steveyegge/beads) by Steve Yegge, and I’m
grateful for the idea — it genuinely changed how I work with agents.
If you’re not familiar with Beads, the core insight is that git-native issue tracking
raises an agent’s capacity for structured work from ~5-10 to-do items to hundreds of
beads.

tbd builds on that foundation with a simpler architecture: plain Markdown files instead
of JSONL, no daemon, no SQLite, no 4-way sync.
This avoids the edge cases I ran into with network filesystems (Claude Code Cloud),
merge conflicts, and multi-agent workflows.

tbd also adds spec-driven planning and curated engineering guidelines — things Beads
doesn’t attempt. If you already use Beads, `tbd setup --from-beads` migrates your beads
with IDs preserved.

**Scope:** tbd focuses on the *durable layer* — issue tracking, specs, and knowledge
that persist across sessions and live in git.
It does *not* aim to solve real-time multi-agent coordination, which is a separate
problem requiring sub-second messaging and atomic claims.
Tools like [Agent Mail](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/mcp_agent_mail) and
[Gas Town](https://github.com/steveyegge/gastown) address that space and are
complementary to tbd — you could layer real-time coordination on top of tbd’s durable
tracking. See the [design doc](packages/tbd/docs/tbd-design.md) for a detailed
comparison.

### Why spec-driven development?

After months of heavy agentic coding, I’ve found that the single biggest lever for
quality is planning before you code.
A
[carefully written spec](https://github.com/jlevy/speculate/blob/main/about/lessons_in_spec_coding.md)
lets you think through what you’re building, catch design problems early, and break the
work into well-defined beads.
The agent then implements each bead with clear context about the bigger picture.

This matters because with a good spec broken into beads, you can leave an agent running
overnight and come back to code that’s well-structured and coherent — not a pile of
disconnected changes.
tbd bakes in shortcuts for the full cycle: writing specs, breaking them into beads,
implementing, validating, and shipping.

### Was tbd built with tbd?

Of course! I boostrapped with the original `bd`. It imported from `bd` and began
self-hosting its own tasks, then took over its own specs and reminds itself of its own
coding guidelines. Here’s what that looks like in practice:

**Specs:** tbd has dozens of active and completed plan specs, such as:
- `plan-2026-01-15-tbd-v1-implementation.md` — The original v1 design
- `plan-2026-01-20-streamlined-init-setup-design.md` — Redesigning the setup flow
- `plan-2026-01-26-configurable-doc-cache-sync.md` — Making the doc system configurable
- `plan-2026-01-28-cli-add-docs-by-url.md` — Adding `--add` for external docs

**Beads:** Features are broken into beads and worked through systematically.
For example, the current list of open beads for this project looks like

```
$ tbd list --pretty 
tbd-0nuf      P2  ○ open  [feature] Add remote vs local issue counts to tbd stats
tbd-1r0w      P2  ○ open  [epic] Spec: CLI Output Formatting Consistency

```

### Can I add my own guidelines?

Yes.
tbd comes with 17+ bundled guidelines, but you can add your own team’s docs from any
